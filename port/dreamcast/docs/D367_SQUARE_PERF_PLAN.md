# D367 square performance plan: r101 at 15 fps real time

Owner: the D367 main session, which since 2026-09-25 coordinates parallel lanes (section "Current order
and status") and lands every patch. Started 2026-09-24 from the user's play tests. The repeatable loop
lives in the `re4-dreamcast-square-perf` skill. This file is the plan and the ledger: update the ledger
with every measured arm, and the plan when an item lands or is dropped.

## Persistent goal (user, 2026-09-24)

**This is the standing goal until it is reached. Iterate on this plan without deviating, unless a measured
better solution appears; then record the switch and why in the ledger.** Every session resumes here.

## Goal (user, 2026-09-24)

- **The r101 square must run at least 15 fps at real game speed, "at any cost, or the player can't play".**
  The one-Ganado house fight "felt heavy" too; quiet areas feel fine.
- The game runs one logic tick per 33.3 ms. With frame pacing (render skip), one drawn image per two ticks
  is 15 fps at real speed. So the budget per drawn frame is **2 x logic + render <= 67 ms** (hardware model).
  Exact form: **W + tau <= 66.7 ms**, W = a drawn tick, tau = a skipped tick (PACE_CATCHUP=2 still runs all
  logic, Trans, effects and iTask; it skips ModelRender, ModelTrans for the dropped image, TA and present).
  Measured directly by a square arm built with `PACE_CATCHUP=2 PACE_FORCE=2` (every second image dropped):
  the hwproject figure is then the mean of W and tau per tick, so W + tau = 2 x that figure.
- Never changed: collision, event sequencing, game state, AI decisions. Render-only changes keep the logic
  trace STRICT. FTRV/FIPR maths in logic is allowed as a measured option (deterministic, last-bit FP
  policy, collision checked separately). Parking far, unseen Ganados (ACT_CAP) is approved.

## 30 fps rethink (user, 2026-09-25): the coarse complete square first

**Correction (user review, 2026-09-25):** steps 1 and 2 below ran every arm, the controls
included, with ACT_CAP=6, which throttles parked Ganados. Their G, R and STRICT results describe the
throttled encounter. The reference is the **uncapped baseline** at the end of this section: G_q 37.52,
R 5.03, gap 12.55 ms with the margin.

Source: `C:\Game Dev\Emulators\re4-research\RE4_DC_30FPS_RETHINK_2026-09-25.md`. The SH4ZAM review
(`re4-research\sh4zam-audit-20260925\AUDIT.md`) gives techniques for step 2 and math candidates for step 3.

The aim is to preserve RE4 gameplay; visuals and engine may change a lot. The per-tick budget is:
- gameplay G <= 24 ms;
- render R <= 6 ms;
- margin 3.33 ms.

The G/R split may move between 22/8 and 28/2.

Order:
1. Qualify the deeper no-draw boundary with a side-effect audit, and pair it with drawing on the same
   stack. Prepare the authorized calibration disc.
2. The coarse complete square, R <= 6:
   - the real game, with every enemy, event, the HUD and audio;
   - crude articulated actors on the gameplay transforms;
   - scenery aligned to the unchanged collision;
   - baked light, blob shadows, and simple effects that keep combat feedback;
   - the renderer reads compact gameplay records.
3. Close G <= 24: pose evaluator, collision index, effect behaviour and RNG separated from display.
4. 30 fps on stock hardware.
5. Restore appearance.

**Accounting.** Work = model total minus the replayed waits. Three kinds are subtracted:
- re4dc_pace_end;
- re4dc_vi_retrace_count;
- `main`'s self time. That is the game's own vsync spin (`while vsync_cnt < system_vcnt`), inlined in
  main. The model replays it at Flycast's pace. main's real self time is 0.01 ms in every arm; the rest
  is the spin: 0.12 in sq47, 1.10 in sq48.

`scripts/gwork.py` does this subtraction.

### Step 1: the qualified no-draw boundary, PACE_TRANS_SKIP=4063 (2026-09-25)

Side-effect audit of the presentation stages that a dropped image skips, i.e. what they write that
gameplay reads:
- **FilterTrans.** Filter08Trans calls fRand1_1 (three Rnd() each) twice per frame while
  Status_flg[3] 0x08000000 is set (scope / slow mode). That touches the shared RNG, so FilterTrans
  always runs (bit 32 is left out of the mask).
- **Effects.** Every est-spawned effect takes `Rand_seed = Rnd() | Rnd() << 8 | Rnd() << 16`
  (est.cpp). Espgen01's trans runs a HideCheck; Espgen45's trans clears Status_flg[1] 0x20.
  - With bit 2048, a dropped image's EspTrans / EspgenTrans run logic-only: esp ids 09 / 0E / 45 / 47
    still queue their draws, Espgen01's trans runs, and the Espgen45 clear happens.
  - Render() still runs that image's OTs when anything was queued.
- **GXPeekZ** is a stub (0xFFFFFF) on the DC, so HideChecks are pure camera / geometry functions here.
- **Presentation only:** CtrlMgr.trans, ShadowTrans, ClothDraw, TransTexRenderMgr, IdSys.move/trans,
  DrawOTag(MainOt[4]), cMes.Move/Trans and Render().

Traces (r101 bell fight warp, 420 s):
- **tr26** (mask 2047) failed on the render-only Status_flg bits. These are now masked in the trace
  with LOGIC_TRACE_MASK_RENDER.
- **tr28/tr29 and tr30/tr31** were STRICT, with one extra line query per frame in about 480 frames:
  the sound system's own sndWallCheck / sndVolCtrlAtCheck, tagged "sq" since. The first tag hit the
  stub trap.
- **tr32/tr33** (4063) were STRICT over 4403 frames with every decision identical: em-em 2.64M
  results, 319k line queries, 62.9k area checks, 182k damage tests, and the effect behaviour hashes
  ep/eg. Only the sound queries differ, as they do between two controls.

Cost: sq43 32.70 hw ms/tick of work against the never-draw control sq45 at 37.15 (-4.45). The
unqualified 2047 mask was 32.58. **G_q = 32.70** is the retained work the coarse square builds on.

### Step 2: the coarse complete square, COARSE=1 (2026-09-25)

The code is `port/dreamcast/game/coarse.cpp`, plus `re4dc_coarse_begin/end` in native_ui.cpp and the
gating in trans.cpp. In in-room play (the pacing context), every tick runs its presentation stages in
the qualified mode. A drawn coarse tick keeps TexRender (the HUD's render textures). Render() runs
OTs 0 / TEX_RENDER1, then draws the image from gameplay records instead of the world OTs:
- **World:** every live collision piece (SatMgr) through its XZ block tree (distance, behind, side
  planes), each triangle once (bitset).
  - Front faces only.
  - Invisible walls are skipped. Collision walls are one-sided and so are the game's line tests, so
    the camera's line (target -> lens) ignores a wall it leaves through the back. One-way barriers can
    therefore sit in front of the lens. r101 piece 0 polygon 690 (attr 40000000, no special bit) sat
    0.5 m in front and covered the view in v0.1..v0.3.
  - Not drawn: back faces, walls with the player behind their plane, and camera see-through
    attributes (the camera's scenery test: attr 0x800000 | 0x1C2810 | 0x400).
  - Flat lit by the world normal in the village's tones, near-clipped at 40 mm, fog table with the
    source's far (FOG_FAR).
- **Actors:** the player, the partner and every drawn cEm in view, as camera-facing ribbons along the
  parent -> part segments of the gameplay skeleton.
  - Limb half-width 38-60 mm, at most 0.3 × the bone.
  - Bones under 60 mm (face, fingers) are skipped.
  - A blob under each actor.
- **Effects:** a billboard per live world-space effect (record position, size, colour). Screen
  sprites are left out, and so are faint ones (alpha < 64) and any at the lens (< 300 mm); the
  radius is capped at 32 px.
- **Output:** one untextured OP header, store-queue vertices (8 words), FSRRA reciprocals.
- **OTs 9-18 stay the source's:** effects that carry state, HUD, messages, filters, letterbox.

The HUD gauge is a translucent lens over the view. With v0.1's light palette its unlit LCD segments
showed ("10" read as "88"); the village tones fix it. The port's ClearZbuf is a GX sink, so the HUD's
depth-tested parts also meet the coarse depth.

Per image (v0.4, sq48, room frames 1000-1119):
- 5 pieces, 116 blocks, 254 polygons drawn (229 back faces, 24 invisible walls);
- 20 actors, 263 segments, 55 effects;
- 932 triangles, 2118 vertices (max 2191);
- TA input 68 KB (peak 72 KB), against 632 KB (peak 831 KB) for the source;
- texture VRAM 1.52 MB used against 1.69 MB;
- heap 4 work backing unchanged (504 KB peak).

| arm | what | work hw ms/tick | R per image |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| sq45 | never draw, full presentation stages | 37.15 | - |
| sq43 | never draw, qualified mask (G_q) | 32.70 | - |
| sq46 | every tick drawn, source renderer | 102.13 | 64.98 (vs sq45) |
| sq44 | every tick drawn, COARSE v0 (prisms) | 41.36 | 8.66 |
| sq47 | every tick drawn, COARSE v0.1 (ribbons, fast emit) | 38.71 | 6.01 |
| sq48 | every tick drawn, COARSE v0.4 (front faces, invisible walls, palette) | 37.66 | **4.96** |

R v0.4 breaks down into two parts.

The coarse pass, about 2.66 ms:

| item | ms |
|---|---:|
| world blocks | 1.08 |
| actors | 0.88 |
| setup + effects | 0.43 |
| emit | 0.27 |

Source work still invoked on a drawn tick, about 2.1 ms:

| item | ms |
|---|---:|
| IDSystem::unitTrans | 0.48 |
| HUD id quads (81 PSMTXConcat calls per tick from re4dc_draw_id_quad, draw_id_quad, resolve, ui_draw_quad, ui_submit) | ~0.6 |
| model asset preparation | 0.18 |
| ExecOt | 0.13 |
| OSCheckHeap | 0.12 |
| GXProject | 0.09 |
| small rows | ~0.15 |

Also on a drawn tick, partsWorldCalc costs +0.32 ms: the same 718 calls per tick as in sq43, slower
because the image's work displaces its data in the cache.

Look: the village tones, Ganados as stick figures, and the HUD readable. Leon's jacket cloth bones
draw as a curtain of slabs; that is appearance work (step 5).

Gameplay (tr40, v0.4 with every tick drawn, GAME_DECISION_TRACE=1) against the control tr32: STRICT
over 4403 frames, every decision identical:
- em-em 2,638,643;
- line queries 319,083;
- area checks 62,885;
- damage tests 182,091;
- ep / eg effect behaviour.

Position drift is 0. Only the sound system's own queries differ (415 frames), as between two controls.

**Paced timing** (hw model, 30 ticks/s: 30·G + F·R <= 1000):
- every tick drawn: 37.66 ms per tick, i.e. 26.6 fps at 88.5% speed;
- Smooth (15 fps floor): 2 × 32.70 + 4.96 = 70.4 ms per image, i.e. 14.2 fps at 94.7% speed;
- real speed: 981 of 1000 ms/s go to logic, leaving F <= 3.8 images/s.

**Fit / gap (capped, ACT_CAP=6; superseded by the uncapped baseline below):** R fits (4.96 <= 6).
30 fps needs G + R <= 33.33 - 3.33, i.e. G <= 25.0 against 32.70: a gap of 7.7 ms.

**Code (parked).** coarse.cpp, PACE_TRANS_SKIP and the trace hashes stack on the unlanded frame-pacing
stack (pace.cpp / pace.mk, the main.cpp loop), so they land with pacing: the user's standing priority
"rebase, gates, land". The snapshot of the whole private tree against 4594c51 is
`/root/probe/d367-agents/warp/patches/square-rethink-snapshot-4594c51.patch`:
- sha256 95cd58a5589ac39c76ef2b414ebf7059c36ecb5bbba45849c0fbed8581c09a6e;
- 31 files;
- `git apply --cached --check` passes at 4594c51;
- tree5 private commit b7a1382.

It also carries tree5's other private knobs (GAME_SKEL_AUDIT, GAME_IK_PASS, POOL_PEAK_LOG). The
pacing landing extracts from it.

### Uncapped baseline (user review, 2026-09-25): the reference for the rethink

The user's review caught a baseline problem. Steps 1 and 2 above used ACT_CAP=6 in every arm, the
controls included:
- ACT_CAP_CREEP 4 runs a parked Ganado's update only once every fourth tick;
- the counts show it happened: 8 of 14 cEm10::move calls per tick, i.e. 6 skipped per tick, 720
  over the 120 measured ticks.

So the STRICT result (tr40 vs tr32) only proves that coarse drawing preserves the **throttled**
encounter. **Preserving RE4 gameplay is judged against the uncapped encounter (ACT_CAP=0).**
ACT_CAP stays an approved option for the 15 fps plan. Capped numbers are a labelled variant, never
"preserved gameplay".

The same flags as sq43-sq48 with ACT_CAP=0 (act_cap.cpp is not linked, so no act_cap symbols).
At runtime: 14 cEm10::move calls per tick in every uncapped arm.

| arm | what | work hw ms/tick | R per image | capped twin |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| sq49 | never draw, full presentation stages | 41.53 | - | sq45 37.15 |
| sq50 | never draw, qualified mask (**G_q**) | **37.52** | - | sq43 32.70 |
| sq51 | every tick drawn, source renderer | 104.75 | 63.22 (vs sq49) | sq46 102.13 |
| sq52 | every tick drawn, COARSE v0.4 | **42.55** | **5.03** (vs sq50) | sq48 37.66 |

The cap hid **+4.82 ms of gameplay per tick** (G_q 32.70 -> 37.52). Coarse R barely moves (4.96 -> 5.03).

R v0.4, uncapped, breaks down as follows.
- The coarse pass, 2.64 ms:
  - world blocks 1.07;
  - actors 0.86;
  - setup + effects 0.44;
  - emit 0.27.
- Source work still invoked on a drawn tick:
  - IDSystem::unitTrans 0.49;
  - HUD id quads ~0.3;
  - model asset preparation 0.18;
  - ExecOt 0.12;
  - OSCheckHeap 0.12;
  - GXProject 0.09.
- Displacement: partsWorldCalc +0.33 and PSMTXConcat +0.31 on the same calls (+27 Concat from the HUD
  quads). The image's code and data evict the skeleton's.

Per image: 931 triangles and 2115 vertices; 20 actors, 263 segments, ~56 effects. Same TA / VRAM /
heap class as sq48.

**Paced timing** (hw model, 30 ticks/s):
- every tick drawn: 42.55 ms per tick, i.e. 23.5 fps at 78.3% speed;
- Smooth (2 ticks per image): 2 × 37.52 + 5.03 = 80.1 ms, i.e. 12.5 fps at 83.3% speed;
- real speed is out of reach: 30 × 37.52 = 1126 ms of logic per second of game time, so even with no
  drawing the square runs at 88.8% speed.

**Fit / gap (uncapped):** complete 42.55 ms per tick, against 33.33 bare (-9.22) and 30.00 with the
margin (**-12.55**). R fits (5.03 <= 6). **G_q must fall from 37.52 to <= 24.97.** The calibration disc
still awaits the console run.

Gameplay, uncapped (GAME_DECISION_TRACE=1, 420 s, r101 bell-fight warp): tr41 (control: source
renderer, ACT_CAP=0) against tr42 (the coarse candidate: every tick drawn, PACE_TRANS_SKIP=4063,
COARSE=1, ACT_CAP=0). **STRICT over 4185 frames, every decision identical:** em-em 2,897,312 results, 411,031 line queries
(6.6M candidate polygon tests), 59,618 area checks, 210,951 damage tests, ep / eg effect behaviour;
position drift 0 (41,978 enemy samples). Only the sound system's own queries differ (392 frames), as
between two controls. **The coarse square preserves the uncapped encounter.** (Both trace arms carry
the play stack's render-only knobs, FOG_FAR / CROWD_LOD / ACTOR_FOG_GATE; no act_cap symbols in
either ELF.)

Where uncapped G_q goes, by source file (sq50, capped sq43 in brackets). These locate experiments;
they are not achievable savings.

| group | files | hw ms/tick |
|---|---|---:|
| animation / skeleton | model.cpp 4.05, motion.cpp 2.46 (5.44 capped), ik 0.51, native_motion 0.22 | 7.24 |
| collision | atari.cpp 3.70, at_mod.cpp 2.57, at_sub.cpp 1.90 (7.07 capped); sce_at 0.37, atariInfo 0.35 | 8.89 |
| shared matrix / trig | PSMTX asm 3.32, math_sub 2.62, game30_trig 1.41, sub2 0.76 (RotVector, distances), vec 0.43, mtx 0.29, acos 0.25, quat 0.12 | 9.18 |
| effects | esp_sub 1.07, esp 0.59, est 0.43 (EspDelete: 5 calls, 7.8k instructions each), esp_efm 0.34, esp48 0.28, espgen 0.26, esp15 0.15 | 3.12 |
| cloth | pendulum.cpp | 1.01 |
| Ganado behaviour | em10 0.84, em_sub 0.35 (line / cube tests), em 0.18 | 1.37 |
| port bridges | parts_bridge.cpp (workAt / frozen lookups, ~3700 calls per tick) | 0.85 |

The cap's +4.82 lands mostly in:
- skeleton: model / motion / ik +1.16;
- collision: +1.10;
- shared math: +1.20;
- effects: +0.65;
- Ganado behaviour: +0.29.

The part-world pass takes two paths:
- **Ganado FTRV path:** 33 calls and 1122 parts per tick, 1.62 ms, 254 instructions per part.
- **Library path (Leon, objects):** 73 calls and 655 parts per tick. It costs 1.59 ms in its own code
  plus ~0.8 in Concat / MultVec / TransMatrix, i.e. ~3.6 us per part against ~1.45 on the FTRV path.
- The compiled FTRV path spends most of its instructions on addressing: SH-4 FP loads have no
  displacement form, so each field access costs three instructions.
- It also spends 3 FDIVs per part on a parent scale that all parts of a Ganado share.

**Next, the user's order:**
1. Whole animation / skeleton operations: compact bone data, fewer intermediate loads / stores, every
   gameplay update kept, conversion costs measured.
2. Collision traversal: compact spatial data and conservative rejection, keeping the original
   candidate order and decisions.
3. Visual simulation (cloth, effects), removed only after identifying their gameplay readers, keeping
   state changes and RNG calls.

### Current order and status (updated 2026-09-25 evening: version C measured, parallel lanes)

**How the work runs now (user, 2026-09-25 evening): parallel, non-overlapping agent lanes.** The user:
"I don't want to spend more time benchmarking. I want to focus on the remaining optimization that can be
parallelized." Per change: one cost arm and one STRICT gate (vs tr56, tr42, tr84), no series. Each lane
develops in its own tree with its own arm prefix and hands its patch to the main session.

| lane (arm prefix) | tree (under /root/probe/d367-agents) | owns |
|---|---|---|
| cl characters | coarse-actors-4k/stack-tree | fitting the approved Leon and Ganado meshes to the character code, losslessly (look unchanged); then a cheaper adapter; then integrating the external agent's cast models. No model building. Fitting and the FTRV adapters landed 9df764b (characters 22.42 -> 15.84 ms); next: the external agent's models |
| vl vertex loop | lane-vloop/tree | ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL: generated SH-4 vertex kernels for the fast actor path. Rev 1b landed 42afaa1: characters -2.97 (vl7); rev 2 landed 7726caa: a further -1.92 (vl13, characters 10.95 over stick figures); rev 3 landed d938501: a further -1.71 (vl17, characters 9.24 over stick figures); rev 4 + rev 5 landed e4fb8e8: a further -0.59 (vl26, characters 8.65 over stick figures; rev 5: movca.l skin entries, the fog gate in asm). Stopped (ROI, user 2026-09-26: the rest is the meshes); ideas left in lane-vloop/STATE.md: meshlet records sorted by palette entry (-0.2..-0.3, overlaps the cast agent's palette work), movca.l on the kernel's output lines (-0.1), the fog gate two entries in flight (-0.1) |
| gc collision | lane-gcol/tree | Landed 7caa2f7: the collision stack (8 knobs), G -1.63 alone (gc13 29.03). Batch 6 (GAME_EM10_SCANPF) lost (+0.08). Batch 7 landed ca229cf: GAME_LINE_LEAF2, GAME_LINE_WALK_PF, GAME_LINE_TAIL, GAME_SCEAT_LIST, -0.62 (gc17 28.41 vs gc13). Batch 8: GAME_SCEAT_LIST rev 2 kept (ff32da9, about -0.04), three items measured and dropped. Batch 9 (GAME_LINE_LEAF2 rev 2: record-address lists + lineLeaf inline; GAME_LINE_WALK_PF rev 2: the root prefetch after the matrix rows; GAME_HC2_PF dropped) gained -0.096 on its own rows but ~0 in total (gc24 28.36 vs gc17 28.41, which lacks the area lists rev 2's -0.05; hitCheck2 +0.065 on identical code): not landed, parked with the lane's patch. **Parked** (ROI, user 2026-09-26; G closed at sq104) |
| fx effects | lane-gfx/tree | Esp / Efm bookkeeping and moves, exact (the RNG sequence kept). Landed 1d3dc4d: GAME_FX_SCAN + GAME_FX_MOVE, G -1.11 (fx9 29.55); the agent moved on to lane ob |
| ob enemy / object bookkeeping | lane-gfx/tree | exact cuts in model.cpp (getPartsPtr, updateOldPos), em.cpp, em_set.cpp (GetEmPtrFromList), dmg.cpp, route_ck.cpp and id_sys.cpp (the HUD units' idSysMove, after a reader audit). GAME_OB_SCAN landed 0862e7c (ob3 29.36 vs fx9 29.55); batch 2 landed 9f66533: GAME_OB_MAT + GAME_OB_PATH, -0.64 (ob7 28.72); GAME_OB_ROUTE dropped (+0.11: its static data moved the layout); batch 3 landed 97874b5: GAME_OB_NEAR + GAME_OB_DECODE, -0.36 (ob14 28.36); GAME_OB_OLDPOS dropped (+0.01). Parked (ROI, user 2026-09-26: the remaining rows sit in other lanes' files). Section "Object bookkeeping" |
| sk skeleton | lane-gskel/tree | skeleton, motion, cloth, maths: exact speedups, and the gameplay-reader map. Landed ee7d080: LIGHT_LAZY, FP_SCHED, HF_INLINE / HF_PF, PWC_SCHED / PWC_PF, TRIG_LEAN, ACOS_LEAN, sk10 29.14 alone (-1.52). Batch 3 landed 4f81bbd: GAME_VEC_NORM_INLINE + GAME_MTXINV_SCHED, sk12 28.94 (-0.20). Dropped: pass-A on the kernel (+0.17), HF_V3 / PMC_PF (+0.22), HF_TYPED (+0.04). Parked: G is under the target (sq104) |
| wd world | lane-world/tree | the textured coarse world, <= ~3 ms: house shells, ground, trees, sky. Landed 6f4c91c (COARSE_WORLD): R +0.68 (wd12), STRICT (wdG4); v10 ground tones 05e402a (private data): the gauge's "88" fixed. Idle until the user's look review (unreplaced collision walls and base floor, the missing hill, the 128 VQ walls) |
| bg route bugs | lane-bugs | the pre-pivot backlog: memory load / unload, freezes, the r100 -> r101 -> r103 playthrough (stopped 2026-09-25 before its first checkpoint; relaunched 2026-09-26 at the user's question: triage from the docs, the user's play logs and a fresh route check on today's code, then the top three fixes, each audited) |

- **The main session** coordinates, lands every patch through warp/tree7 (knob-off identity, a carry-over
  build of the arm's flags, then the commit procedure), keeps these docs current and owns the coarse HUD
  fix (unlit "88" ammo digits, a flat lens).
- **Models:** an external agent the user launches builds and reduces the rest of the first level's cast
  (r100 / r101 / r103: Ganado variants, held items and hats, animals, crows, Leon's weapons) in the private
  `re4-assets-private/cast-20260925/` (prompt: `character-prototype-20260925/CAST-AGENT-PROMPT.md`). No
  in-session agent builds models; the cl lane integrates what it delivers.

**The order we follow now (user, 2026-09-25):**
1. **Land the coarse renderer with frame pacing.** Done: **f4da5fd** (patch land2-pacing-coarse.patch,
   sha256 a0cae359...): frame pacing (PACE_CATCHUP, pace.mk), PACE_TRANS_SKIP, the decision-trace tags
   and COARSE v0.4, all default off. Knob-off identity: default and canonical (VMU_DEBUG_SLOT=0) images
   byte-identical to 161341b + the working diff. Carry-over: tr42's flag set rebuilt from the landed tree
   matches the measured tree5 build in 445 of 453 objects (strip-debug); the other 8 are items kept out
   (below) and the debug-slot build stamp. So tree5's gates hold for the landed code: the forced-skip and
   qualified-mask STRICT arms, tr42 STRICT vs tr41, sq50 / sq52. Still private (tree5): the skeleton-step
   kernels (GAME_PWC_KERNEL / GAME_PMC_KERNEL / GAME_HERMITE_FAST; landed later, ddea9bf), COARSE_HOUSE, the per-part
   model-diagnostic latch (unconditional, so not in a knob-off landing: its own patch), SS_UI_ORDER, MOTION_RESERVE / MOTION_USAGE_LOG,
   HEAP_CENSUS / HEAP_REPLACE_LOG / POOL_PEAK_LOG, GAME_SKEL_AUDIT, GAME_IK_PASS. PACE_CATCHUP is not in
   the canonical recipe yet (play discs pass `PACE_CATCHUP=2 PACE_MODE=fast PACE_CAP=2`); the pacing
   player setting is the title Options row "Frame pacing: Smooth / Fast / Off" (user decision
   2026-09-24; no boot question), a separate later item.
2. **R headroom.** Done: **801d72d** (default off; knob-off identity, tr55 carry-over): GAME_OT_MASK,
   GAME_ID_LISTS, UI_HEAP_LAZY, UI_PALETTE_SLOTS and the coarse effect-loop hoist (with the landed
   UI_HEADERS) cut the source work on a drawn coarse tick from ~2.1 to ~0.8 ms: own rows -1.35 ms, every
   batch STRICT with every decision identical (section "R headroom" below). R (drawn minus never draw, same
   knobs) is now ~4: 3.69 (sq75 - sq67) to 4.37 (sq71 - sq72, both placed), against 5.46 in the batch
   control (sq64 - sq66); code layout moves it by ~0.4. So ~1.6-2.3 ms is left under R <= 6 for
   appearance (a house shell costs ~0.33). The coarse pass itself (~2.75:
   draw_blocks 1.08, draw_model 0.92) is the next R lever when step 5 needs room.
3. **Back to G** in the user's order: collision traversal, then visual simulation (their gameplay
   readers first). Appearance (step 5), extending house shells included, follows G. First G step done
   with item 2: code placement (LINK_ORDER, 801d72d; exact): **G_q 33.39** (sq72; the same code unplaced
   34.64), gap 8.42 to 24.97 (section "Code placement" below). Collision traversal, first step: the em-em
   candidate cache (GAME_ATCHK_CACHE, aeefd26; exact): G_q 32.23 (sq85), gap 7.26 to 24.97 (section
   "Collision traversal" below). Then the workAt inline (GAME_WORKAT_INLINE, 3eaa868; exact): G_q 31.75
   (sq91), gap 6.78. Then the line queries' leaf kernel (GAME_LINE_LEAF, cf46edc; exact): G_q 31.31 (sq94),
   gap 6.34. Then their block walk kernel (GAME_LINE_WALK, ba73027; exact): G_q 30.94 (sq96), gap 5.97. Then
   the pieces' transforms in that kernel (GAME_LINE_PIECE, 4e394ea; exact): G_q 30.66 (sq97), gap 5.69. Then
   the effect pools' scans and moves (GAME_FX_SCAN + GAME_FX_MOVE, 1d3dc4d, lane fx; exact): **G_q 29.55** (fx9),
   gap **4.58** (section "Effect pools" below). Then the collision stack (the sphere walk, the cube memo, the
   far rect reject, the y rows, the id-first scans and the hit lists; 7caa2f7, lane gc; exact): gc13 **29.03 alone**
   (-1.63 vs sq97; section "Collision stack" below). The two lanes' cuts are in different functions; if they
   add, G ~27.9 (gap ~2.9), not measured on one build yet.
   **Measurement base:** the lanes measure on warp/tree5, which carries the skeleton kernels (GAME_PWC_KERNEL=3,
   GAME_PMC_KERNEL=1, GAME_HERMITE_FAST=1; step "skeleton", 37.52 -> 34.40), so every G_q above includes them.
   They landed default off as ddea9bf, so the landed tree reproduces that base. The combined never-draw
   control on the landed stack, **sq99** (the effect pools, the collision stack without SPHERE_BACKFACE, the
   kernels and the landed order file, built from warp/tree7): **G_q 28.29**, gap **3.32**. The naive sum is
   27.92; the +0.31 residual is code layout, mostly EspMove 0.23 -> 0.57 with identical code, so the order
   file (generated from sq67 / sq68, before these landings) is regenerated after the next landings. Then the
   skeleton lane (ee7d080, section "Skeleton lane"): sk10 29.14 alone (-1.52), and the object scans
   (GAME_OB_SCAN, 0862e7c, lane ob): ob3 29.36 on fx9 (-0.19). Everything landed, on one build: **sq100**
   (tree7 land16, the old order file): **G_q 26.34**, gap **1.37** (-1.95 vs sq99, where the two lanes measured
   -1.71 alone). The order file regenerated from sq100 and a drawn run of the same build (sq101) lost: sq102
   26.72 (+0.38; re4dc_sincosf +0.11, PSMTXRotAxisRad +0.07, RotMatrix +0.06: placement, not code), so the
   landed order file stays. Then collision batch 7 (ca229cf, -0.62 on gc13) and the object batch 2 (9f66533,
   -0.64 on ob3) landed. The landed stack with both, **sq103** (tree7 land20m, the landed order file):
   **G_q 25.22**, gap **0.25** (-1.12 vs sq100 against -1.26 measured alone; the line piece's root prefetch
   +0.07 here, dropped in the lane's batch 8).
   Since then GAME_SCEAT_LIST rev 2 (ff32da9, about -0.04) and the object batch 3 GAME_OB_NEAR + GAME_OB_DECODE
   (97874b5, -0.36 alone) landed: sq103's 25.22 less those estimates ~24.8, under 24.97; the next landed-stack
   control measures it together with the skeleton lane's batch 3.
   The skeleton lane's batch 3 (4f81bbd: GAME_VEC_NORM_INLINE + GAME_MTXINV_SCHED, -0.20 alone) landed next. The
   landed stack with everything, **sq104** (tree8 land24, the landed order file): **G_q 24.57** (-0.65 vs sq103;
   never drawn, uncapped; estimate -0.60: PSVECNormalize -0.25, PSMTXInverse -0.22, the object batch 3 rows -0.27 (L_cleanup_loop, memmove, word, decode, memcpy), EspMove +0.11 and hitCheck2 +0.09 with unchanged code (layout)), **under the 24.97 target by 0.40**: G is closed on the never-drawn control; the lanes that were
   carrying G park. At 30 fps that leaves R <= 8.76 (33.33 - G, no margin): version C's R 13.29 was 4.53 over (12.70 and 3.94
   after the vertex kernel rev 4 + rev 5, e4fb8e8), which the characters carry (cl: the external cast refit, then its integration).
   **Lanes by return (user decision 2026-09-26).** Small G items now sit under the 0.3-0.4 ms layout noise, the
   hardware model is uncalibrated (calibration disc c8 waits for a console run), and once G is under the target
   each G ms buys one R ms while version C's R (13.3) is ~5 ms over the 30 fps allowance. So: gc parks after
   batch 9, ob after batch 3, vl after rev 4, wd idles after v10; sk continues until G closes; the character
   integration (cl: the external agent's refit, being finished) and the route bugs (bg, relaunched) carry the
   rest. Small wins land together.
   The rest of G runs in the lanes above: gc the em-em rows, ob enemy / object bookkeeping, sk skeleton /
   motion / cloth / maths. The reduced characters (appearance, step 5): section "Reduced characters and the
   character path" below.

**Where each step of the rethink stands:**

| step | state |
|---|---|
| 1. Qualified no-draw boundary | done: PACE_TRANS_SKIP=4063, STRICT; G_q 37.52 uncapped. Calibration disc c8 awaits the user's console run |
| 2. Coarse complete square | done: landed f4da5fd; R headroom landed 801d72d: source work ~2.1 -> ~0.8 ms, R ~4, STRICT every decision |
| 3. Close G <= 24 | skeleton step (37.52 -> 34.40), code placement (801d72d, -1.25), the em-em candidate cache (aeefd26, -1.16), the workAt inline (3eaa868, -0.48), the line queries' leaf kernel (cf46edc, -0.44), block walk kernel (ba73027, -0.37) and the pieces' transforms in it (4e394ea, -0.28) and the effect pools (1d3dc4d, -1.11), and the collision stack (7caa2f7, -1.63 alone), all exact: the skeleton lane (ee7d080, -1.52 alone) and the object scans (0862e7c, -0.19): the landed-stack control sq100 **G_q 26.34**, gap 1.37 to 24.97 (sq99 28.29 before the last two); since then collision batch 7 (ca229cf, -0.62 alone) and the object batch 2 (9f66533, -0.64 alone): sq103 **G_q 25.22**, gap 0.25; in lanes: gc line kernels / area array, ob enemy / object bookkeeping, sk skeleton / motion / cloth / maths and the gameplay-reader map |
| 4. 30 fps on hardware | waits for 3 and the calibration run |
| 5. Restore appearance | one-house test measured (below); version C measured (cl21: R 26.47 with the reduced characters, 22.42 over stick figures; section "Reduced characters and the character path"); the cl lane's fitted meshes + FTRV adapters (landed 9df764b): 15.84 over stick figures, R 19.89 (cl42); the vertex kernel (42afaa1, rev 2 7726caa, rev 3 d938501: 9.24 over stick figures, vl17) and the coarse world (6f4c91c: R +0.68, section "Coarse world"); in lanes: vl vertex loop rev 4, the world's near-ground tone (the gauge's "88" in one view); the world's look review is with the user; the external agent: the first level's cast models; the main session: the coarse HUD (fixed by the world's ground except in one view, section "Coarse world") |

**What remains on the coarse renderer** (answer to the user, 2026-09-25):
1. Landing (order item 1): done, f4da5fd.
2. Source work still invoked on a drawn tick: ~0.8 ms after order item 2 (was ~2.1): the HUD's id quads
   ~0.49 (27 per tick: texture lookup, PSMTXConcat, 4 GXProject, the native UI submit and resolve), the
   IDSystem lists ~0.1, small rows. EspDelete (0.42) and audio_step (0.15) run on every tick: G, not R.
3. Appearance (step 5): actors are ribbons by default (Leon's jacket cloth draws as a curtain of slabs;
   the reduced characters are version C, below); scenery is flat collision (the wd lane textures it) (no ground texture, trees, fences, props, the well, sky); doors draw as flat slabs from
   their own collision pieces (they move correctly); interiors are flat; effects are plain billboards and
   screen sprites are left out. Open bug: the HUD shows unlit "88" ammo digits and a flat lens (the
   main session owns the fix).
4. Rooms: only r101 has run coarse; r100 / r103 not yet; the house data is r101's.
5. The step-2 spec's "compact gameplay records": it reads the game's own structures.
6. Not measured: PVR fill / ISP time (outside the CPU model); the console calibration.

#### Reduced characters and the character path (2026-09-25)

Version C is the coarse renderer, today's G and the reduced models the character lane integrated (the
3,989-triangle Leon with hair v2 and the 874-triangle Ganado; private bundles). Measured by the character
agent on a snapshot of tree5 (coarse-actors-4k/stack-tree), r101 square frames 1000-1119, ACT_CAP=0;
never-draw G cl23 30.66 (as sq97); gate cl24 STRICT vs tr56, tr42 and tr84. Every figure names its image.
Caveat: the fixture faces a wall (0-1 Ganado visible, 6 character meshes submitted), so a view full of
Ganados costs more.

| version | image | W a drawn tick | R | every tick drawn | paced to full speed |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---:|
| A (cl27) | source renderer, source characters | 99.58 | 68.92 | 10.0 fps at 33% speed | 1.16 fps |
| A' (cl26, benchmark only) | source renderer, the reduced characters (ACTOR_SWAP) | 93.68 | 63.02 | - | 1.27 fps |
| C (cl21) | coarse world, reduced Leon and Ganados | 57.13 | 26.47 | 17.5 fps at 58% speed | 3.0 fps |
| C, fast path so far (cl42) | the same image: meshes fitted losslessly + FTRV adapters | 50.55 | 19.89 | 19.8 fps at 66% speed | 4.0 fps |
| C, + vertex kernel (vl7) | the same image: + ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL=1 (rev 1b) | 47.58 | 16.92 | 21.0 fps at 70% speed | 4.7 fps |
| C, + vertex kernel rev 2 (vl13) | the same image: + ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL=1 (rev 2) | 45.66 | 15.00 | 21.9 fps at 73% speed | 5.3 fps |
| C, + vertex kernel rev 3 (vl17) | the same image: + ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL=1 (rev 3) | 43.95 | 13.29 | 22.8 fps at 76% speed | 6.0 fps |
| C, + vertex kernel rev 5 (vl26) | the same image: + ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL=1 (rev 4 + rev 5) | 43.36 | 12.70 | 23.1 fps at 77% speed | 6.2 fps |
| B (cl22) | coarse world, stick figures | 34.71 | 4.05 | 28.8 fps at 96% speed | 19.8 fps |

Paced to full speed = (1000 - 30 x 30.66) / R images a second. On the landed stack's G (sq100, 26.34) the
same R would pace to (1000 - 30 x 26.34) / R: vl13 14.0 fps, vl17 15.8 fps, B 30 fps (an estimate: R was measured on the
older G base, never on one build with sq100's stack).
On sq104's G (24.57, everything landed through 4f81bbd; G closed) the same estimate gives (1000 - 30 x 24.57) / R:
vl26 20.7 fps, B 30 fps (capped). 30 fps needs R <= 8.76 (no margin) or <= 5.43 (the 3.33 margin): vl26 is 3.94
over without margin; the rest is the characters' meshes (the external cast refit).

- The new renderer against the old with the same characters (cl26 - cl21): -36.55 ms a drawn tick (-39%),
  whole frame: mostly the world (scenery meshes ~13 ms), the game's draw preparation, effects and
  lighting. The characters' own share of that difference wasn't measured separately, so the earlier
  estimate that the renderers' character setup differs by only 2-6 ms is neither confirmed nor refuted.
- The reduced characters cost 22.42 ms over stick figures (cl21 - cl22): re4dc_actor_submit 12.5, the
  Ganado adapter 3.7, the Leon adapter 2.1, skin palettes 1.3, the rest spread. The cl17-based estimate
  of R ~28 for C was close (26.47 measured).
- Why they cost that much (profile of the agent's crowd runs cl15-n0 and n8; re4dc_actor_submit runs
  3.68M instructions a tick for Leon + 8 Ganados):
  - ~130 instructions per transformed vertex: compiled C with stack spills and a mul.l index scale;
  - a Ganado triangle costs 1.41 transformed vertices and 2.28 strip vertices (Leon 1.17 and 2.42); a
    mesh prepared for this path needs ~0.6-0.7 and <= 1.3;
  - more weight palettes than the source models (Leon 665 vs 359, Ganado 193 vs 111).
  Triangle count doesn't predict the cost (the agent's triangle-only estimator failed).
- **The fast character path (user, 2026-09-25), two parallel lanes:**
  1. cl (coarse-actors-4k/stack-tree): fit the approved meshes to this code offline, deterministically and
     losslessly (<= 1.3 strip vertices and ~0.6-0.7 transformed vertices a triangle, weight palettes <= the
     source's, no section submitted twice; the look unchanged), then a cheaper adapter. Estimate: the
     characters from 22 to 13-15 ms.
  2. vl (lane-vloop/tree): ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL, a hand-written SH-4 vertex loop (transform, outcodes,
     lighting) in platform/native_actor_fast.cpp, default off, with a =2 bit check against the C path,
     render-only STRICT. Estimate with the fitted meshes: ~6-8 ms.
  At G <= 24 with ~6-8 ms of characters, C paces at ~23-28 fps to full speed (R ~10-12); 30 fps needs
  R <= 6.
- **Fast path, first results (the cl lane; landed 9df764b, default off).** Same fixture and image as cl21,
  G 30.66:
  - Part 1, lossless mesh fitting (private bundle private-fast-v2; tools in the private
    character-prototype-20260925/tools/fastpath): strip vertices a triangle Leon 3.00 -> 1.55, Ganado
    3.00 -> 1.81; palette runs Leon 990 -> 880, Ganado 313 -> 269; triangles, winding and headers
    unchanged (VERIFY PASS). cl28: W 56.41 (-0.72). The first cut reordered Leon's 63 coincident
    double-sided hair triangle pairs and showed a dark sliver behind his ear; v2 keeps their order.
  - The estimate's targets don't hold losslessly: transformed vertices a triangle stay Leon 0.91 and
    Ganado 1.40 (the Ganado's UV seams are real gaps) and palettes stay 665 / 193 (merging identical
    weights saves 15 and 2). Going further needs new assets: the external agent's.
  - COARSE_SKIN_FTRV=1: the adapters build the palette matrices with FTRV (coarse_skin_sh4.S: bone
    transforms for the bones the palettes use, entries grouped by bones, two FTRVs in flight, MOVCA
    output lines): adapters ~6.3 ms (with their concats) -> 1.21. cl42: **W 50.55, R 19.89** (19.8 fps
    every tick drawn at 66% speed, 4.0 fps paced); **the characters cost 15.84 ms over stick figures**
    (was 22.42).
  - Gates cl29 / cl31 / cl33 / cl43 STRICT vs tr56, tr42 and tr84, zero drift; the =2 check build
    (cl43) logs max differences of 1.8e-7 in rotation and 0.0022 units in translation.
  - Look: with the game frozen on one frame (COARSE_FREEZE_AT, diagnostic), frame 1109 differs in 18
    pixels (1 from the meshes, one colour step; 17 FTRV edge pixels) and frame 5999 in 12. FTRV render
    maths with logic STRICT is a standing user decision.
  - Next: the vl lane's vertex loop (re4dc_actor_submit ~11.4 ms of the 15.84); the 6-8 ms estimate
    assumed ~0.6-0.7 transformed vertices a triangle, which needs the external agent's meshes.
- **Vertex kernel (lane vl; rev 1b landed 42afaa1, rev 2 7726caa, rev 3 d938501, rev 4 + rev 5 e4fb8e8; default off).** ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL: the fast actor path's
  position + skin transform and light pass as generated SH-4 kernels (platform/avk_sh4.S, made by
  tools/game30/avk/mkavk.py from templates and fixed schedules; six variants), the same FP operations on the
  same operands; the kernel returns to C at each palette change.
  - vl7 (cl42's flags + ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL=1): **W 47.58 (-2.97), R 16.92; the characters 12.87 ms over stick
    figures** (was 15.84). re4dc_actor_submit 11.38 -> 4.19 plus the kernel 3.74; the loop 70 instructions /
    44.7 cycles a vertex (C 138.5 / ~142).
  - Gates: vl8 (C, =2) STRICT vs tr56 / tr42, 62.56M vertices, 0 mismatched words, max screen error
    0.000 px; vl9 (A, =2) STRICT, 58.55M vertices and 24.54M lit vertices, 0 mismatches.
  - Left in rev 1: a palette entry changes every ~6 vertices in C, so 1687 calls a tick cost ~330K of the
    kernel's 747K cycles. Rev 2 (in-kernel palette switch, entry builds, the fog-gate loop with one sqrt,
    emit_meshlet two vertices at a time, constant-colour parts): estimated a further -4 to -5 ms, characters
    ~8 ms over stick figures. Below that needs fewer vertices / palettes: the external agent's meshes.
  - Rev 2 (7726caa): the kernels switch palette entries themselves (kernel calls ~1687 -> ~136 a tick; ~1650
    in-kernel switches at ~62 cycles), prefetch records ahead and clamp the light without a branch; at a
    stop one asm pass builds every palette entry the rest of the meshlet needs (~81 cycles an entry against
    ~225 in C); the fog gate loop takes one square root after the loop; emit_meshlet handles two vertices at
    a time; constant-colour parts compute the colour word once. **vl13: W 45.66 (-1.92 vs vl7), R 15.00; the
    characters 10.95 ms over stick figures.** re4dc_actor_submit 4.19 -> 2.92, the kernel 3.74 -> 2.92; all-in
    82 instructions / 60.1 cycles a vertex (rev 1b 93 / 76.7).
  - Gates: vl14 (C, =2) STRICT vs tr56 / tr42, 56.2M vertices, 0 mismatched words; fog gate, meshlet copy and
    palette builds (9.33M entries) 0 mismatches; max screen error 0.000 px. vl16 (A, =2) STRICT, 54.1M
    vertices and 22.7M lit vertices, 0 mismatches.
  - Left: the batch palette build scans every remaining record after a stop (~7200 records a tick, 1.49 ms);
    rev 3 builds every entry at the Frame's first skinned meshlet, est. a further -1.3 to -1.5.
  - Rev 3 (d938501): no scan. avk_build_all builds every position entry of a skinned Frame once, at its first
    skinned meshlet (Frame::avk_all, reset where skin_ready is cleared), as a linear asm walk over the palette
    and the skin table with both prefetched two entries ahead (9,331,281 builds against rev 2's 9,331,201 on
    demand). **vl17: W 43.95 (-1.71 vs vl13), R 13.29; the characters 9.24 ms over stick figures.**
    avk_build_positions 2.241 -> avk_build_all 0.760 (1823 entries, ~83 cycles each); the kernel +0.16 (its
    switch stub's matrix loads now miss). Gates vl18 (C, =2) / vl19 (A, =2) STRICT vs tr56 / tr42, every check
    0 mismatches.
  - Rev 4 (landed with rev 5 as e4fb8e8): the fog gate's palette loop with one pointer per column (the same fmac
    shape), the constant colour unrolled x4, the build loop in asm with pair stores. vl23: W 43.66 (-0.29 vs
    vl17): fog gate 0.904 -> 0.556, constant colour 0.129 -> 0.074, but the build loop only 0.760 -> 0.706: it
    waited on the skin table's write-allocate fills (issue 54.4K + prefetch waits 62.7K + D-miss 17.5K cycles a
    tick). Gates vl24 (C) / vl25 (A) STRICT vs tr56 / tr42, every check 0 mismatches.
  - Rev 5: the build loop allocates each 64-byte skin entry's two lines with movca.l (no fill, no skin prefetch;
    32-byte-aligned tables only, every allocated line overwritten; the ready bytes set with one memset after the
    loop): 86 -> 48 cycles an entry; the fog gate in hand-written asm repeating rev 4's compiled operations
    (T kept negated): 61 -> 45 cycles an entry. **vl26: W 43.36 (-0.30 vs vl23), R 12.70; the characters 8.65 ms
    over stick figures** (actor area 3.83 -> 3.29; about +0.2 of unchanged logic rows is layout). Gates vl27 (C)
    / vl28 (A) STRICT vs tr56 / tr42, every check 0 mismatches (movca_frames logged; Flycast has no operand
    cache, so movca.l runs there as a plain store). The asm repeats contracted (fmac) code: game30.mk stops an
    ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL build under GAME_FP_CONTRACT=off without the GAME_FP_RENDER=fast exemption.
  - The kernel loop itself runs at ~48 cycles a vertex over ~9,580 vertices a tick (2.3 ms): fewer vertices
    and palette entries in the cast meshes is the lever left.
- New models for the rest of the first level's cast come from the external agent (section "Current order
  and status"); the cl lane integrates them.
- The coarse-path HUD in C ("88" ammo digits, a flat lens) was not a HUD bug: the gauge's lens and ring are
  translucent, and the coarse floor behind them was the light collision colour (~(90,80,65) against the
  source's dark grass ~(16-40)). The coarse world's ground (COARSE_WORLD bit 2, the source's tones; 6f4c91c)
  fixes it: the gauge reads "10" in all 8 gate shots (wdG4) and in the look review's tree-line view (v3).
  In the south view (v1e) the near ground behind the gauge rendered ~(65-74, 64-80, 57-82) against the
  source's 16-41 and the gauge read "88" until v10 (05e402a; below): it reads "10" in v1e, v3 and the fight view.

#### Coarse world (lane wd, 2026-09-25; landed 6f4c91c, default off)

COARSE_WORLD=bits (needs COARSE=1; render-only): the coarse view's world beyond the flat collision pieces from
read-only room data prepared offline (coarse_world.cpp + the generated private coarse_world.h; textures staged
with EXTRA_TEXDIRS). 1 house shells (each house BIN as its baked 128 VQ render shell in place of its outer
collision polygons; r101's well BIN 45 never shelled), 2 ground (3.2 m cells coloured from the source ground,
one grey detail texture), 4 sky (the dome fading into the fog colour; the PVR background takes the fog colour),
8 trees (the Standard impostor records as atlas quads in the punch-through list; needs TREE_IMPOSTOR=1).
- Cost (r101 fight view, coarse world + stick figures, FOG_FAR 18000; R added over the control wd1, work
  34.48): v6 +2.38 (wd9: the sky cost ~0.9 with no sky on screen), v8 +1.34 (wd11), **v9 +0.68 (wd12)**:
  shells 0.82, ground 0.24, sky 0.10, box tests 0.06; 786 shell triangles, 35 groups culled a frame, no near
  clips. v9 transforms the sky once a frame, drops a triangle wholly off one side before clipping, and tests a
  group's bounding sphere against the view's sides first.
- Gate wdG4 (v9, bits 15, ACT_CAP=0, FOG_FAR 25000): STRICT vs tr56 (8295 frames) and tr42 (8144).
- VRAM at frame 960: 1,513,728 bytes in use (coarse without the world 1,524,896); peak 1,578,368 in both
  against 2,444,032. World textures 84 KB. coarse_world.o 138 KB text + 16.5 KB bss, linked only with the knob.
- Look (the lane's flags for the user): 128 VQ walls with baked light look blotchy up close (the source reads
  as smooth plaster with a dark base); the ground has the source's dark tones; tree colour is 0.75 x the house
  tint; the sky fades between 4 and 22 m. Sky and trees are not in the fight view, so the lane captured a
  look review beside the source renderer (arm wdS; sheet warp-sq-wdG4-v3/look_review.png, villagers gone:
  v1e the square facing south, v3 the tree line). Flags for the user: collision walls the world does not
  replace stay flat beige (boundary walls behind the tree line, fences, small structures); the render-only
  hill west of v3 (not collision) is absent, so trees and boundary walls show where the source shows the dark
  slope; the near ground is lighter than the source's. Waiting on the user's review.
- v10 (05e402a, private data; the code change is a comment): the ground took the source ground textures' colours
  unlit; the source multiplies them by the lit vertex colour its Standard mesh gives each part (native_static
  light_part), only 0.08-0.18 on r101's ground. v10's ground colours are the source layers times that lit colour
  per covering triangle corner (the lane's private lit_model.py matches every dumped part within 0.03). Ground
  luminance p50 36 -> 6; the near ground in v1e now (17,15,13) against the source's (17,16,13). Cost wd16 = wd12
  (W 35.16, the same code); gate wdG5 STRICT. Header coarse_world_v10.h sha256 65f8529ed1ce55d348d50c679cdd696ae7e212298b0c7fb7a50623640e318c85 (copied untracked as
  coarse_world.h; nothing in the build checks the version, so check the hash). Left for the look review: a beige
  band at the house bases in v1e is the collision base floor (poly 80), unreplaced like the other collision walls.
- Landing: ported from the lane's tree5 base (COARSE_HOUSE, the never-landed one-house test it supersedes, and
  SS_UI_ORDER stripped; a 3-way merge onto the files carrying the character adapters).

#### Effect pools (lane fx, 2026-09-25; landed 1d3dc4d, default off)

Never-draw uncapped arms against sq97 (30.66), exact, the RNG sequence kept:
- GAME_FX_SCAN r3 (needs GAME_ESP_OWNER=1): slot bitmaps (live esp slots, owner rows, occupied espgen
  controllers) so the source loops step over runs of clear bits, re-reading the map at every step, with
  the same slot order and the same source test on every slot reached. EfmDelete lists obj 4 / 5 / 9 once
  per ObjMgr alive-list generation (with GAME_ATCHK_LIST=1 and GAME_WORKAT_INLINE=1; else the source
  loop). EspDelete 0.432 -> 0.038, EfmDelete + EfmDeleteSub 0.430 -> 0.011, EspgenDelete 0.182 -> 0.060,
  EspgenTrans / EspgenMove -0.06 together.
- GAME_FX_MOVE r2: CommonMove with ColorUpdate inlined and AnmMove with EspGetAnmAddr inlined, through
  walking-pointer float loads and stores (the same operations on the same operands in the same order);
  cEsp48 skips sinf for |x| < 2^-27 (fdlibm returns x there: 2 of its 3 axes on every call in the
  square; sinf calls 985 -> 439 a tick, 0.435 -> 0.302); cEsp15 memoises its camera axes on the 9
  camera words. CommonMove + ColorUpdate 0.666 -> 0.597. AnmMove (+0.03) and cEsp48 (+0.04) lost to
  I-cache layout: the order file needs regenerating (~0.08 ms; ESP_IsActive, its first entry, is no
  longer called from EspMove).
- **fx9 (both =1): G 29.55 (-1.11).** Gate fx8 (both =2): tr56 STRICT over 7074 frames, tr42 over 7073;
  dtcmp must-match rows identical, drift 0; FXS map errors 0, FXM 2.9M calls / FX48 1.93M / FX15 275k,
  0 mismatches.
- Dropped: GAME_FX_PREF, the next live effect's 11 lines prefetched: 30.25 (v1) / 29.96 (v2) against
  29.55 without it (the model's one fill bus: demand misses wait behind the burst).
- Left: ~2.1 ms of effect work a tick, mostly each effect's own update and misses on its object; 439
  sinf calls (cEsp48 273, C_QUATSlerp 94, PenClothMove 66) are the sk lane's, bit-identical only.

#### Object bookkeeping (lane ob, 2026-09-25 / 26; landed 0862e7c and 9f66533, default off)

Never-draw uncapped arms on the lane's stack (the effect pools on). All exact; no static data at =1.
- GAME_OB_SCAN (0862e7c): cDmgMgr::hitCheck over the alive list, cDmgMgr::move without the dieCheck calls that
  can't change a work, GetEmPtrFromList from EmMgr's alive list (needs GAME_WORKAT_INLINE=1), IDSystem::move's
  deeper levels from a list built in pass 0. ob3 29.36 vs fx9 29.55 (-0.19); gate ob4 STRICT.
- GAME_OB_MAT (9f66533): idSysMove03 keeps l_mat / mat while the unit's rotation, position and group parent's
  matrix version are unchanged (versions in IdUnit pad_D8). ob5 29.16 (-0.20 vs ob3): RotMatrix 0.446 ->
  0.373, PSMTXConcat 0.591 -> 0.532. Gate ob6 STRICT; OBM 507,905 calls, 0 mismatches.
- GAME_OB_PATH (9f66533): idSysMove00's path points from the same de_Boor_Cox arithmetic in stack arrays instead
  of 3 + n + m heap blocks per call (the heap's lists end each source call as they started, so no later
  allocation moves). ob7 28.72 (-0.44 vs ob5): mem_alloc, strchr, OSAllocFromHeap gone. Gate ob8 STRICT; OBP
  53,249 calls, 0 fallbacks, 0 mismatches.
- Dropped: GAME_OB_ROUTE (getNearPoint's sorted list kept for the last four positions): +0.11 (ob9), 104 bytes
  of static data moved every later bss object and the heap; hit rate 32%.
- Audited, not pursued: moving idSysMove00-04's values to draw time. Next-tick readers (the binoculars, the
  item / map subscreens) read them on the following drawn tick, so it isn't exact for the image and would move
  the cost into R. ~0.25 ms of HUD unit work is left.
- Batch 3 (landed 97874b5): GAME_OB_NEAR (getNearPoint's ten-nearest insertion as one test-and-shift loop in
  place of the two memmove calls GCC made per inserted point, 606 a tick) and GAME_OB_DECODE (the effect record
  reader: aligned words read in place instead of ~1,260 4-byte memcpy calls a tick; decode() expands an aligned
  record with the mask words in registers). **ob14 28.36 (-0.36 vs ob7)**; gate ob15 STRICT, OBN / OBD 0
  mismatches. GAME_OB_OLDPOS dropped: +0.01 (ob13; updateOldPos is cache fills, ~2300 a tick).
- Parked (ROI). Cross-lane ideas left with estimates: cModel::getPartsPtr inline in model.h (-0.10..-0.15; callers
  in the gc / sk files), em10SomebodyDamageNowCk over the alive list (-0.15; em10.cpp is shared with gc),
  native_motion's word() like GAME_OB_DECODE (-0.04; sk's file), cEm::checkStatus inline (-0.03).


#### Collision stack (lane gc, 2026-09-25; landed 7caa2f7, default off)

Never-draw uncapped arms against sq97 (30.66), order file hot-c3-8k-sw.ld (the landed
link-order/r101-square-c3-8k.ld plus `*spw_sh4.o(.text)` after cSatBlock::hitCheckSphere, now landed). All
exact (GAME_ATRECT_FAR decision-exact by a bound); each knob's =2 check build runs the original and compares.
- GAME_SPHERE_WALK (needs GAME_FP_CONTRACT=off): the swept-sphere block walk in platform/spw_sh4.S,
  resumable (a leaf hit moves the sphere's end; the walk goes on against the moved end), pieces walked first
  on the x / z rows, wallAdjust's two calls sharing one walk. rev 1 +0.20 (gc1); rev 2 (shared-difference
  edge tests, reordered rejects, the replay) -0.26 alone (gc3); ~-0.40 in the stack.
- GAME_CUBE_MEMO: the camera line's box test keeps face normals and plane offsets per body (cameraHitCheck
  tests the same bodies 5 times a tick); rev 2 moved the memo out of line (rev 1's inline copy cost +0.19
  in ComnHitCheck). ~-0.28.
- GAME_ATRECT_FAR: At_em_sphere_rect_ck returns 0 before the frame build when both positions lie beyond
  the box's reach plus a rounding margin (99.97% of calls; sincos per tick 436 -> 248). ~-0.39.
- GAME_LINE_YROW (needs GAME_LINE_PIECE=1): hitCheck2 computes only the y rows of a walked piece's ends
  (PSMTXMultVec 587 -> 103 calls a tick). ~-0.05.
- GAME_EM10_IDFIRST, GAME_OBJHIT_IDFIRST: the id before be_flag. -0.04 and (with the lists) ObjHitCheck -0.12.
- GAME_EMHIT_LIST, GAME_OBJHIT_LIST (need GAME_ATCHK_LIST=1): the alive-list array with prefetch instead of
  the pNext chase. OBJHIT_LIST was developed in tree5 and lands with the stack.
- **gc9 (the first five): 29.21 (-1.45). gc13 (all eight, plus the parked SPHERE_BACKFACE): 29.03 (-1.63).**
  Gates gc10 / gc14 (=2): tr56 STRICT over 8296 frames, tr42 over 8145, dtcmp must-match rows identical,
  drift 0, 0 mismatches in every check (SPW 229k queries, CBM 459k, EID 3.28M, LYR 909k, ARF 795k, OHL 44k,
  OID 11.0M, EHL 44k); gc12 (the fast paths live) STRICT, identical, drift 0.
- Parked: GAME_SPHERE_BACKFACE (gc11 -0.02, noise; STRICT), GAME_ATPOS_MEMO + GAME_ATRECT_MEMO (gc5 +0.30:
  memo table misses ate the gain; ARM superseded by ATRECT_FAR).
- Layout noise: the effect rows (EspMove, AnmMove, sinf, ColorUpdate) swing by up to +0.4 between builds with
  identical call and instruction counts; the lane judged each knob by its own rows.
- Batch 9 (not landed; parked): GAME_LINE_LEAF2 rev 2 (lnk2_sh4.S lists carry polygon record addresses, the
  AtPoly survivors written in place, the chunk's second index line prefetched at entry; lineLeaf always_inline
  into blkPolyLineCkCore) and GAME_LINE_WALK_PF rev 2 (re4dc_line_piece2 issues the root block's prefetches
  after the matrix row loads). Own rows: re4dc_line_piece2 0.350 -> 0.309, leaf2 1.243 -> 1.214,
  blkPolyLineCkCore 0.225 -> 0.186 (-0.096 together). But gc24 28.36 vs gc17 28.41 includes the area lists
  rev 2 (gc17 predates them, about -0.05), and hitCheck2 lost +0.065 on disassembly-identical code (its
  literal-pool loads: layout; gc21 showed the same), so the batch is ~0 in total. Gate gc23 (=2 + decision
  trace) STRICT vs tr56 (8296) / tr42 (8145), dtcmp identical, drift 0, LK2 / LWP / HCP 0 mismatches. Dropped:
  GAME_HC2_PF (hitCheck2 one piece ahead, +0.024 on its rows). Patch lane-gcol/patches/
  leaf2-lists-inline-rootpf-on-728545d.patch (sha256 fa82c232...) for a later landed-stack try; ideas left:
  hitCheck2's literal-pool loads out of the piece loop (-0.03..-0.05), a two-deep piece lookahead
  (-0.04..-0.07).
- Batch 8: GAME_SCEAT_LIST rev 2 (landed ff32da9): the generation-keyed area list serves every walk of the area table
  (SceAtCheck, SceAtCheckFieldInfo, SceAtCheckMoveScrAt, the camera / item checks, sceAtLink_check), up to 128
  records a table (r101 68, r100 64). About -0.04 from its own rows (measured inside gc21, 28.29 vs gc17 28.41,
  with two items later dropped; gate gc20 STRICT, SAL 1.81M steps, 0 mismatches). Dropped after measuring: the
  piece-entry root prefetch removed (+0.016), leaf2 record-address lists (+0.03: lineLeaf went out of line),
  hitCheck2's hot / cold split (+0.16).
- Batch 7 (landed ca229cf): GAME_LINE_LEAF2 (platform/lnk2_sh4.S: the leaf kernel software-pipelined, the
  polygon two ahead prefetched), GAME_LINE_WALK_PF (platform/lnw2_sh4.S: three prefetches), GAME_LINE_TAIL
  (At_poly_line_tail: At_poly_line_ck from the t test on for leaf survivors), GAME_SCEAT_LIST (sceAtCheck_main
  over per-type lists of the area records, rebuilt when a generation counter changes). **gc17 28.41 (-0.62
  vs gc13)**: line leaf 1.509 -> 1.243, walk 0.872 -> 0.757, At_poly_line_ck 0.229 -> tail 0.105,
  sceAtCheck_main 0.180 -> 0.040; the piece +0.03 (its root prefetch, dropped next). Gate gc18 STRICT, dtcmp
  identical, 0 mismatches in LK2 (15.4M polygons), LWP, LTL, SAL. The order file places lnk2 / lnw2 /
  At_poly_line_tail after their counterparts.

#### Skeleton lane (lane sk, 2026-09-25; landed ee7d080, default off)

Never-draw uncapped arms on tree5 (with the skeleton kernels), against sq97 (30.66). All exact.
- GAME_LIGHT_LAZY: cLightInfo::updateMatrix keeps its inputs and builds imat only when read
  (lightHitCheckBBox). The lane's reader map (lane-gskel/STATE.md, design note 1): imat is the only
  skeleton / light output that is draw-only and a pure function of current state; everything else (part
  mat / world / r_scale, motion outputs, matBlend / QUATSlerp state, IK, cloth, pendulums, updateOldPos, the
  neck / waist passes) is read by gameplay or carries history. Drawn every tick: 0 of 235,520 updates
  materialized. ~-0.1.
- GAME_FP_SCHED: GCC's pressure-aware pre-allocation scheduler on the skeleton / maths objects: -0.24.
- GAME_HF_INLINE, GAME_HF_PF (with GAME_HERMITE_FAST): ~-0.05; hermiteFast -0.08 (dmiss 47.5k -> 30.4k).
- GAME_PWC_SCHED + GAME_PWC_PF (with GAME_PWC_KERNEL): the part-world loop rescheduled, the next part's
  lines prefetched at exact field addresses: kernel 1.96 -> 1.47, sk6 29.50. The kernel is now bound by the
  memory bus (~169 cycles a part); PREFs are spread out because real SH-4 may stall on a second miss.
- GAME_TRIG_LEAN: sinf / cosf / re4dc_sincosf restructured around the same float operations (exhaustive
  host test: 0 mismatches over 2^32 inputs); GAME_ACOS_LEAN: ef_acos / ef_asin with -fno-math-errno (the
  sqrtf guard's other path is unreachable there; it cost a __unordsf2 call per acosf). sincosf 0.858 ->
  0.631, sinf 0.392 -> 0.295, __unordsf2 0.104 -> 0.007, acosf 0.256 -> 0.193.
- **sk10 (all): 29.14 (-1.52).** Gates: skM1 STRICT vs tr56 / tr42; skM5 / skM6 (coarse drawn every tick,
  every knob, =2 where available) STRICT vs the kernels' control skM0 over 8943 / 8998 frames, dtcmp
  must-match rows identical, drift 0.
- Dropped: IK_KPASS (+0.14), PARTS_FAST (~0.03 for +908 bytes), HF_V2 (+0.145).
- Next (estimates): pass-C partial recompute (addRot subtrees only, ~0.2, needs a writer audit), pass-A on
  the kernel with the IK part set (~0.1-0.15), PSVECNormalize inline at the hot callers (~0.05-0.1).

- Batch 3 (landed 4f81bbd): GAME_VEC_NORM_INLINE (include/vec.h, src/lib/mtx.c, platform/mtx.cpp): C_VECNormalize's
  contract-off body inline at the callers (PSVECNormalize 1,309 -> 527 calls a tick; =2 compares, "VNRM" 6.99M
  calls, 0 mismatches) and GAME_MTXINV_SCHED (platform/mtx_sh4.S): PSMTXInverse scheduled statically (~83
  cycles) by tools/game30/mtx_inverse_sched.py, proven EQUIVALENT to the old body by
  tools/game30/prove_mtxinv_sched.sh (fpsym2 --strict; both alias partitions and determinant branches). **sk12
  28.94 (-0.20 vs sk10)**: PSMTXInverse 0.560 -> 0.287, VEC_NORM_INLINE ~-0.06 net (the inlining callers +0.15).
  Gate skM8 STRICT vs skM0 (9,273 frames), dtcmp identical, drift 0. Both need GAME_FP_CONTRACT=off, and
  GAME_MTXINV_SCHED also GAME_SH4_MATH=1: game30.mk stops the build otherwise (added at landing).
  Dropped after measuring: GAME_PASSA_IK (pass A on the kernel, +0.17: the C walk costs more than the FTRV run
  saves), GAME_HF_V3 + HF_PF=2 + PMC_PF (+0.22: the prefetches' fills are charged to the demand loads under the
  one-fill model), GAME_HF_TYPED (+0.04: hermiteFast specialised by key layout removed only the dispatch).
  The lane's lesson: exact instruction-count cuts keep winning (TRIG_LEAN, FP_SCHED, MTXINV_SCHED); prefetch and
  specialisation do not.

#### Skeleton operations (user's order, item 1; 2026-09-25)

Never-draw uncapped arms (PACE_FORCE=A, PACE_TRANS_SKIP=4063, ACT_CAP=0), work = total - waits:

| arm | knob (stacked) | work | vs previous | gameplay |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| sq50 | reference | 37.52 | - | tr41 |
| sq53 | GAME_PWC_KERNEL=1 (Ganado part-world pass as one SH-4 loop; exact twin of GAME_SKEL_FTRV=1) | 37.13 | -0.39 | tr43 (=2): 4.28M parts compared, 0 mismatched words; tr44 STRICT vs tr41, 4186 frames |
| sq54 | GAME_PWC_KERNEL=3 (every model's pass on the kernel: Leon and objects move to FTRV, last-bit) | 34.93 | -2.20 | tr45 vs tr41: every decision identical (em-em 2.90M, 411k line queries with 6.6M candidate polygon tests, 59.6k area, 211k damage); player drift 0, enemy max 0.000488 units |
| sq56 | + GAME_PMC_KERNEL=1 (partsMatCalc's memo hits as one loop; exact) | 34.73 | -0.20 | tr46 STRICT vs tr45, 4236 frames |
| sq57 | + GAME_HERMITE_FAST=1 (HermiteInterpolation restructured; exact) | **34.40** | -0.33 | tr47 (=2): 1.53M calls, 0 mismatches; STRICT vs tr46, 4202 frames |
| sq58 / sq59 | + GAME_SKEL_PF=1 / =2 (prefetch the next part's lines) | 34.50 / 34.54 | +0.10 / +0.14 | tr48 STRICT; dropped (the one-fill bus: the prefetches wait) |
| sq60 | sq57 + GAME_WORKAT_INLINE=1 (demand-backed workAt inline; exact) | 34.62 | +0.22 | tr49 STRICT vs tr47, 4202 frames |

- GAME_WORKAT_INLINE removes 0.83 ms of its own rows (calls and instructions as expected) but I-miss
  and D-miss rise +0.35 each elsewhere: code layout. Kept as an exact knob to re-measure with
  profile-guided function ordering (never-draw arm: I-miss 4.4 ms, D-miss 3.8 ms per tick).
- Recipe for the next steps: GAME_PWC_KERNEL=3 GAME_PMC_KERNEL=1 GAME_HERMITE_FAST=1. =3 is the last-bit
  option (decisions identical); =1 is the exact alternative, 2.20 ms slower. Landed default off as ddea9bf
  (without the parked GAME_IK_PASS, GAME_SKEL_AUDIT and GAME_SKEL_PF).
- G_q **34.40** (-3.12 vs sq50). Complete every-tick-drawn coarse tick: sq61 **39.78** (sq52 42.55):
  25.1 fps at 83.8% speed. Gap: G must reach <= 24.97 (-9.43).

#### One-house test (user request, 2026-09-25)

The user's request: one house on its existing baked appearance, a simple shell, correct doors and
openings; measure the complete cost and inspect it from several angles before extending it.
- **Candidate:** COARSE_HOUSE=1 (test knob). r101 BIN 38 (the house at the fight camera) as its baked
  render shell: bl_house_shell.py --faces 400 --tex-size 256, fitted to the room collision (shell vertex
  -> collision p50 78 mm, placement sign checked). 400 textured triangles, a 256 x 256 VQ bake bound by
  package key, in place of the collision polygons of its outer surfaces.
- **Cost** (every tick drawn, same stack as sq61):

| arm | what | re4dc_coarse_draw | instructions per image | model total | trace |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| sq61 | control (coarse, skeleton knobs) | 0.435 | 48.2k | 39.79 | - |
| sq62 | v1: per triangle cross product, light, 3 transforms, clip loop | 1.038 (**+0.60**) | 140.2k | 40.25 | tr50 STRICT vs tr42, 8078 frames |
| sq63 | v2: 325 positions transformed once, screen-space back faces, light once | 0.762 (**+0.33**) | 91.0k | 40.59 | tr51 STRICT vs tr42 (8111) and tr50 |

  The model totals move by more than the house (+0.46 / +0.80) from layout (the game-logic rows move
  +0.27 / +0.48 in render-only builds). Per image (v2): 123 house triangles drawn, 26 flat ones gone
  (+291 TA vertices, +9 KB vertex data); VRAM +18,432 bytes (VQ; 131,072 as 16-bit); 12.5 KB of tables
  and 11.9 KB of work buffers. Flycast wall time of the house itself: 610 us (v1), 304 us (v2).
- **Views** (hv-* evidence: start, 8 m corner, 13 m side, 19 m across the lane, the rear wall; each
  against the Standard full renderer and the flat coarse view): the shell brings back the roofline, the
  window and door openings and the stone texture that the collision lacks; its 256 bake reads better than
  Standard mode's 64 x 64 shell of the same house.
- **Doors and openings:** the door (SatMgr piece 2, its own collision) draws as a flat slab in its
  opening and moves with the game's door state; the shell leaves that doorway open above ~30 cm.
  The house has an interior (80 piece-0 polygons inside its footprint). v1 hid 22 inside surfaces of its
  walls (see-through from inside); v2 keeps polygons facing away from the nearest shell face, and one of
  them shows as a dark flat triangle in a doorway in the 13 m side view. A volume test (inside the shell)
  is the fix if the houses are extended.
- **Per millisecond:** v2 is ~0.33 ms per house in view with this implementation; with ~2.1 ms of R
  headroom recovered (order item 2), a handful of shells fit. Extending across the village is
  appearance work (step 5) and the user's call after these results.

#### R headroom (order item 2, 2026-09-25)

Every tick drawn (PACE_MODE=off, PACE_TRANS_SKIP=4063, COARSE=1, ACT_CAP=0, skeleton knobs) unless noted;
work = total - waits. Stacked:

| arm | change | work | vs previous | own rows | gameplay |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| sq64 | batch control | 39.68 | - | - | - |
| sq65 | GAME_OT_MASK=1 GAME_ID_LISTS=1 UI_HEAP_LAZY=30 | 38.89 | -0.79 | -0.96 | tr52 (=2): 289k queued units and 103k skipped OT executions, 0 mismatches; tr53 STRICT vs tr42 (8145 frames), every decision identical |
| sq65 (rh1b) | the same build again | 38.89 | 0.00 | - | - |
| sq68 | + UI_HEADERS=1 UI_PALETTE_SLOTS=32 | 38.70 | -0.19 | ~-0.20 | tr54 STRICT vs tr42, every decision identical |
| sq75 | + the coarse effect-loop hoist and a word palette compare | 38.33 | -0.37 | -0.19 | tr55 STRICT vs tr42, every decision identical |

Never-draw twins (PACE_FORCE=A): sq66 control 34.22, sq67 batch 1 34.64 (+0.42: code layout; its own
rows -0.16).
- **GAME_OT_MASK=1:** per-table bits "took an entry" / "took a model entry" since the table's clear;
  ExecOt returns at once for an empty table, and the model-asset signature walk skips tables without
  models. =2 runs both ways and compares ("OTM").
- **GAME_ID_LISTS=1:** IDSystem::trans builds each unit's child lists once per call; unitTrans walks them
  instead of rescanning the 0x80-unit pool for each of the ~38 queued units. =2 compares every queued
  sequence ("IDL").
- **UI_HEAP_LAZY=30:** the native frame stats refresh source_heap_free (an OSCheckHeap walk, ~0.12) every
  30th frame; nothing in the image reads it.
- **UI_PALETTE_SLOTS=32:** the indexed-image palette copies are 32 slots given out least recently used,
  instead of 16 fixed to handle % 16 (the HUD's indexed images evicted each other: 6 full resolves per
  tick); +8.4 KB BSS. Batch 3 compares the palettes in 32-bit words.
- **The coarse effect loop** called ESP_IsActive for each live slot (446 per drawn tick); outside the event
  pause it equals m_Be_flg & 1, so it is called only under the pause.
- A rerun of the same build gives the same numbers to 0.01 ms; the rest of the movement between builds is
  code and data layout (the D-cache and I-cache are direct mapped).
- What R still holds (sq68 - sq67 by rows): the coarse pass 2.75 (draw_blocks 1.08, draw_model 0.92,
  re4dc_coarse_draw 0.48, emit_poly 0.27), the native UI 0.41, source work ~0.4 after batch 3.

#### Code placement: LINK_ORDER (G, 2026-09-25)

The never-draw tick spends ~4.7 ms in I-cache misses and ~4.0 in D-cache misses (both direct mapped:
8 KB / 16 KB). LINK_ORDER=<file> (game30.mk) passes an ld --section-ordering-file that puts the hot input
sections first in .text; tools/d367/ordgen_c3.py writes it from hwproject evidence. Each arm relinks its
control's objects (identical objects, identical .text size, identical instruction counts):

| order | never draw (vs sq67 34.64) | drawn (vs sq68 38.70) | I-miss never draw (4.67) | gameplay |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| v1: 614 sections hottest first (sq70 / sq69) | 34.80 (+0.17) | 38.75 (+0.05) | 5.05 | - |
| **C3, clusters <= 8 KB** (sq72 / sq71) | **33.39 (-1.25)** | 37.76 (-0.94) | 3.74 | tr56 STRICT vs tr55 (8296 frames) and tr42 (8145), every decision identical |
| C3, clusters <= 4 KB (sq74 / sq73) | 33.87 (-0.77) | 37.73 (-0.97) | 4.06 | - |

- C3 (HFSort): exact call edges (every static call site weighted by its execution count in the run's
  counts.bin), each function's cluster appended to its most frequent caller's while the cluster stays
  within 8 KB, clusters placed by hotness per byte. Clusters it formed: collision (getFloor, hitCheck2,
  blkPolyLineCk, At_poly_line_ck, lineOverlap: 2.5 KB, 9.0 ms), the part matrices (matUpdate,
  partsMatCalc, RotMatrix: 3.7 KB), a Ganado's box move and attack checks (7.1 KB), motion
  (MotionMoveCore, hermiteFast: 5.0 KB).
- v1 lost because hottest-first ignores what runs together (hermiteFast and MotionMoveCore collided:
  +0.28 and +0.24).
- The landed order is link-order/r101-square-c3-8k.ld (from sq67 + sq68). It is tied to the code:
  regenerate it after code changes (sections it names that no longer exist are ignored). Square arms
  pass `LINK_ORDER=link-order/r101-square-c3-8k.ld` from here on.

#### Collision traversal (G, order item 3, 2026-09-25)

Collision was ~8.8 ms of G_q 33.39 (by file, sq72: atari.cpp 3.72, at_mod.cpp 2.54, at_sub.cpp 1.87,
sce_at.cpp 0.38, atariInfo.cpp 0.34). Never-draw arms (PACE_FORCE=A, skeleton knobs, the landed order
file), paired with the fresh control sq81 (a full rebuild of the same tree: 33.39, the same instruction
count as sq72):

| arm | change | work | vs control | gameplay |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| sq78 | GAME_LINE_KERNEL=1: a piece's scenery line test (blkPolyLineCk, Core, At_poly_line_ck) as one walk: same blocks, polygons and float expressions | 33.59 | +0.20 | tr57 (=2) 0 mismatches; tr58 STRICT |
| sq79 | GAME_SAT_REJECT=1: skip a piece whose top-level blocks the query's XZ box misses (skips proved by a margin) | 34.01 | +0.62 | tr59 (=2) 0 bad skips; tr60 STRICT |
| sq80 | GAME_ATCHK_CACHE rev 1: em-em candidates kept per list, a counter bumped by every test-changing write | 32.84 | -0.55 | tr62 (=2) 0 mismatches, 74% reused; tr63 STRICT, every decision identical |
| sq82 | rev 2: the changed infos noted in a ring; a reuse re-tests them | 32.48 | -0.91 | tr64 0 mismatches, 87% reused; tr65 STRICT, identical |
| sq83 | rev 3: notes outside a list's body range skipped (rev 4, the fields' address-of deleted, compiles to the same code) | 32.40 | -0.99 | tr66 0 mismatches; tr67 STRICT, identical |
| sq84 | rev 5: the noted infos applied to the kept bodies in place | 32.70 | -0.69 | tr68 0 mismatches, 36 fresh collections; tr69 STRICT, identical |
| **sq85** | **rev 6: + infos found absent from the list remembered per list generation** | **32.23** | **-1.16** | tr70 0 mismatches over 442k reuses; tr71 STRICT vs tr56 and tr42, identical |

- The line kernel: the walk rows fell 3.86 -> 3.50, but hitCheck2's per-query setup rose 0.23. The line
  queries don't cost call overhead; they cost the per-polygon tests (At_poly_line_ck: 1918 a tick, 184
  instructions each).
- The piece reject saved 0.24 in the walks (blkPolyLineCk, lineOverlap) and spent 0.24 on its own test
  (hitCheck2): the pieces it skips already stop at their root box.
- Census (GAME_COL_STATS=1, a stats-only test knob kept in tree5; tr61 STRICT):
  - Line queries repeat 1.9% of the time against the previous tick and 2.3% within a tick, so
    remembering answers can't pay.
  - World-vertical queries are 39.6% of the queries but only 8.2% of the polygon tests.
  - The em-em candidate lists equal the previous collection in 99.995% of the collections: hence the
    cache.
- **GAME_ATCHK_CACHE (landed aeefd26, default off, needs GAME_ATCHK_LIST).** Each list's collected bodies are
  kept while the list is unchanged (its generation, head and length). Every body whose test changed is
  applied to them: removed if its test now fails, inserted at its list position if its test now passes.
  "Every change is seen" holds by construction:
  - With the knob on, m_flag and m_radius2 are same-size wrappers that note a write flipping the test
    (bit 0x200, radius != 0) in a 64-entry ring.
  - Copies between infos and taking either field's address are deleted, so a write that could pass
    the notes doesn't compile.
  - The 15 volatile flag helpers (st2 / st3 rooms, em2b / em35 / em36, wep_mod.h) take the address with
    __builtin_addressof and note the info. Rev 2 had covered 9; a full source search found the other 6
    (none of them built today), and the deleted address-of makes any missed one a compile error.
  - AtariInfoConstruct notes its memset. A source audit of the built modules found no other bulk write
    to a live body.
  - List changes bump the list generation (GAME_ATCHK_LIST).
  - The =2 check build also collects afresh and compares every reuse.
- What each revision taught:
  - Rev 1 reused only 74%: dead Ganados write m_radius2 = 0 and then 0 * 0.7 + 75 every tick
    (em10SlopeMove).
  - Rev 3's range skip showed that rev 2's remaining misses (13%) were not one list's notes breaking the
    other list's reuse: only 66 notes fell outside a list's range.
  - Rev 5's check build found what they were: of ~32k disagreeing notes, 2 were inserts, 7 removals,
    and the rest infos absent from the list. Dead Ganados leave the enemy alive list but keep running
    their move (their own EmAtCheck, then atari.move pulls m_radius2 back to m_radius2_n = 0), so they
    flip their test twice a tick. Rev 5 walked the list for each of them (atchkCandidates 0.41 ms).
  - Rev 6 remembers them: atchkCandidates 0.10 ms (161 instructions per call) in place of
    atchkCollectList's 1.30; D-miss 3.79 -> 3.30 ms.
- Collision after the cache (sq85): ~7.4 ms.
  - Scenery line queries: 4.35 ms. There are 107 a tick (getFloor 42, hitCheck 37, wallAdjust 28),
    walking 629 pieces with 3402 block box tests, 254 leaf visits and 1918 polygon tests. By function:
    At_poly_line_ck 1.60, blkPolyLineCkCore 0.92 (~930 instructions per leaf visit for 7.6 polygon
    tests), blkPolyLineCk 0.81, lineOverlap 0.55, hitCheck2 0.47.
  - Sphere queries: ~1.07 (784 block sphere tests a tick).
  - at_mod: ~1.5 (getPos 0.34, ObjHitCheck 0.32 in 5 calls, At_em_* 0.34, atchkPasses 0.17).
  - sce_at: ~0.3.
- Arms after the cache (never draw, paired with sq85; drawn arms with sq86, 36.45, R 4.22):

  | arm | change | work | vs sq85 | gameplay |
  |---|---|---:|---:|---|
  | sq87 | the order file regenerated from the cache's runs (ordgen_c3.py) | 32.29 | +0.06 | - |
  | sq89 | GAME_OBJHIT_LIST=1: ObjHitCheck walks GAME_ATCHK_LIST's array of the object list, header and id lines prefetched | 32.25 | +0.02 | tr72 (=2) 0 mismatches over 41k calls; tr73 STRICT, identical |
  | sq90 | sq89 + GAME_WORKAT_INLINE=1 | 31.58 | -0.65 | - |
  | **sq91** | **GAME_WORKAT_INLINE=1** | **31.75** | **-0.48** | tr74 STRICT vs tr56 and tr42, every decision identical |

- The regenerated order lost drawn as well (sq88 36.84, +0.39): the landed order stays.
- ObjHitCheck's array walk: its row fell 0.317 -> 0.284 ms, but two prefetches per object took it from
  3,777 to 6,555 instructions a call. Parked in tree5.
- **GAME_WORKAT_INLINE (landed 3eaa868, default off; needs OBJECT_DEMAND=1 ENEMY_DEMAND=1).** A tree5 knob
  since sq60, where it lost 0.22 before code placement (I-miss and D-miss +0.35 each). With the order file
  it pays: the workAt and frozen rows (0.83 ms) go, 96k fewer instructions a tick, I-miss +0.05. The
  demand-backed cObj / cEm managers' workAt reads the slot table inline (include/cManager.h) when no pool
  is frozen for the sub screen (a count parts_bridge.cpp keeps as it freezes and thaws), the array is the
  room's own and the index is in range; every other case takes the bridge as before.
- Arms after the workAt inline (never draw, paired with sq91 unless noted):

  | arm | change | work | vs control | gameplay |
  |---|---|---:|---:|---|
  | sq92 | GAME_LINE_LEAF=1 with a lookahead prefetch, before the workAt inline | 32.07 | -0.16 vs sq85 | tr75 (=2) 0 disagreements over 14.9M verdicts; tr76 STRICT vs tr56 and tr42, identical |
  | sq93 | sq92's kernel + GAME_WORKAT_INLINE=1 | 31.71 | -0.04 | - |
  | **sq94** | **GAME_LINE_LEAF=1, no lookahead** | **31.31** | **-0.44** | tr78 (=2) 0 disagreements over 15.2M verdicts; tr77 STRICT vs tr56 and tr42, every decision identical |
  | sq95 | sq94 + GAME_LINE_WALK=1 (the block walk in a kernel, rev 1) | 31.20 | -0.11 vs sq94 | tr79 (=2) 0 mismatches over 5.33M walks; tr80 STRICT vs tr56 and tr42, every decision identical |

- **GAME_LINE_LEAF (landed cf46edc, default off).** The scenery line queries' leaf loop (blkPolyLineCkCore) ran
  At_poly_line_ck on each untested polygon of an overlapped leaf: 1918 tests a tick at 184 instructions
  each, plus ~75 per index in the loop (2.52 ms). platform/lnk_sh4.S runs the loop's polyBit dedup and
  At_poly_line_ck's first four tests (the plane crossing, the three edge sides) with the same float
  operations on the same operands; the 4.2% that pass all four take At_poly_line_ck and the hit compare in
  index order, so every result, distance compare and normal is the loop's. The leaf rows go from 2.51 to
  2.01 ms (kernel 1.57), 227k fewer instructions a tick. The square's order file places the kernel after
  At_poly_line_ck.
- A lookahead prefetch of the next polygons' vertex and normal lines lost: +42k instructions for -0.08
  D-miss (sq93).
- The original's tests can't be tightened exactly: coplanar segments "hit" through rounding (a horizontal
  segment at floor height gives dp0 = dp1 = 0 and a NaN t, which passes), so only the per-test cost can go.
- The block walk in a kernel (GAME_LINE_WALK rev 1, sq95: -0.11) missed on each next block without
  blkPolyLineCk's prefetch (D-miss 0.13 -> 0.38 ms). **Rev 3 (landed ba73027, default off)** prefetches the
  next block, and hitCheck2 walks each piece first, so a piece without an overlapped leaf (~70%) skips its
  polyBit clear and hit transform: **sq96 30.94 (-0.37 vs sq94)**. The line-query rows go from 4.87 to 4.47
  ms (the kernel 1.03, D-miss 0.05; blkPolyLineCk and lineOverlap gone). tr81 (=2) 0 mismatches over 5.35M
  walks, none took the recursive walk; tr81 / tr82 STRICT vs tr56 and tr42, every decision identical.
- Collision after the block walk (sq96, ms a tick):
  - line queries: the leaf kernel 1.54, At_poly_line_ck 0.23, blkPolyLineCkCore 0.22, the walk 1.03,
    hitCheck2 0.56, plus the pieces' point transforms (hitCheck2 makes 1519 of the 2100 PSMTXMultVec calls,
    59 instructions each);
  - sphere queries ~1.04: hitCheckSphere 0.42 for 784 box tests, of which 201 run all four
    edge-crossing tests and still miss;
  - em-em ~1.1 (getPos 0.34, At_em_sphere_rect_ck 0.25), ObjHitCheck 0.32, cDmgMgr::hitCheck 0.17.
- The pieces' transforms in the walk kernel (GAME_LINE_PIECE, **landed 4e394ea, default off**). hitCheck2
  transformed both ends of the segment into every live piece (1258 of the 2100 PSMTXMultVec calls a
  tick), and ~83% of pieces then end with no overlapped leaf, having used only the ends' x and z. The
  kernel's new entry (re4dc_line_piece) computes those rows with MTXMultVec's contract-off dataflow and
  joins the walk; a piece with a leaf transforms both ends in full, as before. **sq97 30.66 (-0.28 vs
  sq96)**: PSMTXMultVec 0.73 -> 0.44, hitCheck2 0.56 -> 0.43, the walk 1.03 -> 0.88, the new entry 0.32.
  tr83 (=2) 0 mismatches in the ends and the leaves over 5.37M pieces; tr83 / tr84 STRICT vs tr56 and
  tr42, every decision identical.
- Next in collision traversal (the gc lane, lane-gcol/tree): the sphere walk and the first em-em rows landed
  as the collision stack (7caa2f7, section "Collision stack"); the lane goes on with batch 6 (GAME_EM10_SCANPF,
  the Ganado scan's id lines prefetched from the workAt slot table) as increments on its 7cb13bc.
  Visual simulation is the sk and fx lanes' (section "Current order and status").

## Where the time goes (hwproject, r101-bell-fight room frames 1000-1119, Standard stack)

| arm | hw ms | render-side | actors | logic/tick | scenery | ui | 2L+R |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sq0 base (tree5 play stack) | 120.9 | 29.9 | 28.5 | 26.6 | 19.7 | 8.8 | ~147 |
| sq1 ACT_CAP=6 | 115.8 | 28.1 | 28.3 | 23.1 | 20.0 | 9.0 | ~139 |
| sq2 ACT_CAP=6 + ACTOR_FOG_GATE | 114.2 | 27.3 | 29.9 | 21.4 | 19.9 | 8.4 | ~136 |
| sq3 ACT_CAP=4 + fog gate | 113.8 | | | | | | |

**Measured budget (2026-09-24, PACE_CATCHUP=2 PACE_FORCE=2, traced parities split):**

| arm | tau: skipped tick | W: drawn tick | W + tau (budget 66.7) |
|---|---|---|---|
| sq12: sq5 stack (VEC_INLINE, ACT_CAP=6, fog gate) | 45.3 | 106.2 | **151.5** |
| sq13: + CROWD_FLAT, COL_PREFETCH v1, FOG_FAR=18000, CROWD_NEAR=2/5 m/12 m | 45.8 | 99.3 | **145.1** |

What this means:
- Per-tick game work G (game-logic + game-render-side: logic, collision, EmAtCheck, effects,
  Trans/ModelTrans) is ~41 hw ms on **every** tick, drawn or skipped (skipped tick: 20.1 + 21.6; drawn:
  17.2 + 21.8). The drawn-only render R (actors, scenery, ui, copies) is ~60-65.
- **G alone is above 33.3**: even with nothing drawn, the square cannot run at game speed.
- 15 fps at real speed needs 2G + R <= 66.7, e.g. G ~22 and R ~22 (today 2 x 41 + 62).
- So a ms of G is worth two of R: logic items move ahead of render items (FTRV bones, collision,
  EmAtCheck/atchkCollect, effects, trig), and the render items still have to cut R by two thirds.
- Skipped-tick functions (sq12): partsWorldCalc 2.9, PSMTXConcat 2.1, atchkCollect 1.9, At_poly_line_ck
  1.6, MakeWeightPalette 1.2, sincos 1.1, PSMTXMultVec 1.1, EspDelete 0.8, Hermite 0.7. By file:
  EmAtCheck + scenery collision 7.4, skeleton maths 7, effects 3.5, Trans 2.9, motion 1.9.

**Retained work and normal baseline (2026-09-24, sq13 stack):**

| arm | what it runs | hw ms/tick | trace |
|---|---|---|---|
| sq15 | draws every tick (normal play) | **104.5** | render only vs tr2 |
| sq16 | PACE_CATCHUP=2 PACE_FORCE=A: every image dropped (no ModelRender, no ModelTrans) | **39.5** | STRICT tr2 vs tr3, 3277 ticks |

- 39.5 is the work retained per tick today, not an irreducible floor. Drawing adds 65.0 per image;
  ModelTrans for a kept image is ~6.3 (45.8 skipped-tick minus 39.5).
- Retained work by system: skeleton and matrix maths ~14-15 (partsWorldCalc 2.8, mtx_sh4 kernels
  Concat 1.6 / MultVec 1.1 / Inverse 0.6, math_sub RotMatrix/Hermite 3.5, trig 2.6, motion 1.9),
  collision ~8 (at_mod EmAtCheck 3.1 incl. atchkCollect 1.9, atari 3.1, at_sub 1.7), effects ~4.5
  (esp_sub, esp, est, esp48), cloth/pendulum ~1.6, IDSystem 0.9, remainder ~9.
- Milestones: 15 fps at full speed needs roughly 20 retained + 25 drawing (2 x 20 + 25 = 65; today
  2 x 39.5 + 65 = 144). 30 fps needs retained + drawing <= 33.3 in one tick (today 104.5).

## Retained-work savings table (2026-09-24, sq16 never-draw arm, 39.54 hw ms/tick)

Method: sq16 functions.tsv (cost columns) joined with the run's per-PC execution counts
(trace/counts.bin over the 120 counted ticks: entry PC = calls, loop-body PCs = iterations);
scratchpad tools retained.py / calls.py / loops.py. "Exact" = identical results (STRICT gate).
"Last-bit" = the FP policy with a shadow comparison of hit/grounding/collision decisions.
Residuals are estimates until measured; unknown rows need the counter build (next).

Where the time is, by kind: load-use stalls 7.1, I-cache misses 4.5, D-cache misses 3.5 of 39.5
(~15 ms waiting on memory); the rest is issue and FP dependency.

Totals (saving, hw ms/tick):
- Exact, measured-basis rows (1, 2, 3a, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13): ~4.4-6.0.
- + last-bit rows (3b, 6b): ~6.8-9.1.
- + unknown rows at their upper bounds (5, 6a, 12): up to ~13.
- **Best plausible retained work: ~27-33 hw ms/tick against the 14 target (25.5 needed) and the 15 fps
  milestone's ~20 (19.5 needed).**

Verdict: optimising the current per-tick work cannot reach 14 ms, and is unlikely to reach the ~20 ms
of the 15 fps milestone. The work scales with what the square holds each tick: ~2236 part matrices,
~421 live effects, ~150-node actor lists walked 46 times, 23 EmAtCheck bodies. At 30 fps every tick
draws, so deferring presentation work does not help there: 30 fps in the square needs the retained
work itself below ~20 with drawing under ~13, which this table does not support under the gameplay
constraints. For 15 fps at full speed, one architectural lever remains: skip presentation-only work on
skipped ticks (for example part matrices no gameplay code reads). Its size needs the consumer audit.

Next, in order: (1) counter build to settle rows 5 and 6a and list which part matrices gameplay reads
(collision, hit volumes, attach points, IK, events); (2) row 1, the largest exact item; (3) the bounded
skeleton experiment (3a, then 3b and 6b with the shadow check); (4) row 8.

## Skeleton audit (2026-09-24, GAME_SKEL_AUDIT counter build, tree5; last 1800 square ticks)

Arm tr4 (tr2 flags + GAME_SKEL_AUDIT=1): logic trace STRICT vs tr2 over 3035 ticks (read-only counters).
partsWorldCalc hashes every input (local/parent matrices, scales, flags, addRot, pos) and every output
before and after each call, per model; RotMatrix/low_RotMatrix note repeated angles per destination;
getPartsPtr notes callers by phase. Parser: scratchpad sa_parse.py (skill scripts).

Q1, repeated unchanged work: **rare.** 94.1 calls and 1390 parts per tick. Calls with bit-identical
inputs and untouched outputs since the model's previous call: 2.7 calls / 59 parts per tick (4%, crows
em28 and em26, same tick). Calls that changed nothing: 8.0 / 136 parts. 85 of 94 calls follow a real
mutation of the model's outputs or inputs. The redundancy is structural instead:

| caller (model) | calls/tick | parts/tick | pattern | dependency-tracking candidate | parts avoidable (est.) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MotionMove (em15 Ganados) | 14.5 | 493 | all 14 Ganados every tick, parked ones included | parked (unseen) Ganados: compute only the chains gameplay reads (collision parts 0/2 ...), the rest before a draw | ~200-270 |
| cEm10::move (em15) | 7.25 | 247 | second full pass after em10NeckMove / em10WaistMove (they read parts 1-4) | first pass limited to what is read before the second pass | ~150-210 |
| MotionMove + cPlayer::move (Leon) | 3.0 | 357 | three full 119-part passes per tick | same test between passes | ~119-238 |
| crows / em26 / objects | ~70 | ~290 | small models; 59 parts exact repeats | skip exact repeats | ~59 |

At ~3 us per part (partsWorldCalc self + Concat/MultVec/TransMatrix share) the candidates total
**~0.5-0.8 k parts, ~1.6-2.4 hw ms/tick**, each still needing a consumer proof (source + STRICT).

Rotation: RotMatrix 747 calls/tick, 59% all-zero angles (already served by GAME_ROT_CACHE), 21% same
angles as the destination's previous call; low_RotMatrix 886 calls, 12% repeats. Exact memo gain ~0.1-0.2.

Q2, observed part-matrix readers (getPartsPtr, per tick): collision cAtariInfo::getPos parts 0/2 (481),
MotionMoveCore parts 0-15 (286), MotionMove (65), em10 neck/waist parts 1-4 (36), cloth (16), weapon
attach cEmWep::setParentMatCalc parts 10/16/17 (11), Leon eye/waist/push/corner/damage (~10), plus
presentation readers ModelTrans (293, Trans phase), cLightInfo (137), ModelRender (103). Inlined copies
inside model.cpp and direct pList walks are not counted; one recording is not proof of non-use: every
candidate above needs source inspection of its readers before a STRICT experiment.

Q3, stacked: dependency tracking removes whole part updates, so it shrinks the base the matrix-kernel
(3a/3b) and partsWorldCalc (4) rows act on by the same ~35-50%: after it, 3a+3b fall from ~1.1-1.5 to
~0.6-0.9, row 4 from ~0.3-0.6 to ~0.2-0.4. The rotation memo overlaps FSCA (6b) by ~15%.

**Result: dependency tracking and reuse expose ~2 hw ms/tick (1.6-2.4), not the ~12-19 still missing.**
Revised best plausible retained work: ~25-31 hw ms/tick. The 14 ms allocation is not credible for the
square under the gameplay constraints; the 30 fps architecture and budget need an explicit revision.

## Revised approach: bounded architectural investigation (user decision, 2026-09-24)

30 fps stays the objective; 15 fps at full speed stays the intermediate gate. **The 14 ms retained
allocation is retired** (the audit does not support it). The audit justifies revising the engineering
approach, not changing encounters or accepting slow motion (both still rejected).

Budget identity, per second of game time with G = retained work per tick (every tick, 30/s) and R =
drawing cost per image at F images/s: **30 x G + F x R <= 1000 ms.** At G = 28 and R = 25 that is
6.4 fps, not 11-12. Drawing allowance R per image:

| retained work G | R at 30 fps | R at 15 fps |
|---|---|---|
| 20 ms | 13.3 | 26.7 |
| 25 ms | 8.3 | 16.7 |
| 28 ms | 5.3 | 10.7 |

Today: G = 39.5, R = 65.0 (sq16 / sq15).

Qualifications: the 1.6-2.4 ms structural skeleton saving is a hypothesis (reader coverage is
incomplete); 25-31 ms describes the opportunities identified so far, not an architectural limit.

Steps, in order, each measured in full:
1. **Exact collision candidate collection.** Replace the alive-list walks with maintained candidate
   data; measure the entire replacement (mutation hooks, invalidation, rebuilds, order preservation).
   STRICT.
2. **Compact skeleton processing prototype on one representative actor:** contiguous hot data, fewer
   pointer traversals, batched matrix work, dependency-aware partial updates. Measure the complete
   update including gathering inputs and writing results. Before omitting any work, audit direct AND
   inlined readers.
3. **Collision spatial structure prototype:** candidate order and exact final tests preserved,
   maintenance cost included; compared against step 1.
4. **Reassess the combined retained cost, then run the actor-rendering proof** against the matching
   allowance above.

Next checkpoint delivers: a measured retained cost G, the rendering allowance it leaves, and the
quantified remaining gap.

**Order revised (user, 2026-09-24, after the DCA3 / SH4ZAM study,
`C:\Game Dev\Emulators\re4-research\dca3-sh4zam-20260924\FINDINGS.md`):** compact collision candidates
(done, step 1) -> ordered active effects (live-slot index in slot order; slot reuse, iteration, RNG
unchanged) -> actor matrix composition (skin_position_matrix, 1.54 ms/frame in sq15, scalar
skin-to-screen preparation) -> one gameplay matrix chain (skeleton/collision, with the agreed numerical
and collision-decision checks) -> remaining part preparation (packet reserve/begin). Each complete
replacement is measured before stacking. Parked for the matrix-chain item: in partsWorldCalc's
uniform-scale path the concat's translation column equals the MultVec world bit for bit (same SDK
expression tree), so world can be read from the concat and MultVec + TransMatrix dropped; sibling
parts can reuse the parent's reciprocal scales.

### Step 1 result: GAME_ATCHK_LIST (2026-09-24)

EmAtCheck walked the EmMgr and ObjMgr alive lists 46.5 times per tick (~150 nodes each, 6975 node
visits, 651 candidates), stalled on each pNext load. The replacement keeps each list's order in an
array and rebuilds it only when the list changes: cManager.h bumps a generation on every list or
work-array change (deleteList, addListFront/Back, roomInit, arrayAlloc/Free, arrayPush/Pop, and the
demand-backed array_alloc/array_free in parts_bridge.cpp; a source search found no other pNext or
pAlive writer for these lists). Each call still tests every body's live m_flag / m_radius2 in list
order, with the next bodies prefetched, so the candidates and their order are unchanged. Caching the
candidate set itself is not exact: m_flag has 281 write sites (some through union views) and em10
rewrites m_radius2 every tick.

Complete cost, never-draw arms (PACE_FORCE=A), paired baseline sq17 (= sq16, 39.54):
- sq19 (kept): **38.42 hw ms/tick (-1.12)**. atchkCollect 1.92 -> 1.16 (walk incl. syncs), atchkPasses
  0.30 -> 0.18 (candidates now cached), EmAtCheck +0.02 (sync/rebuild), bumps not visible.
- Maintenance measured in the check build (tr5, =2): 30 rebuilds in ~197k list uses over the run,
  longest list 248 (array 320, no overflow), **0 mismatches** between the cached order and a list walk.
- Variants that did not beat it (the SH-4 has one fill in flight, so extra prefetches wait): radius
  pointers + array-line prefetch every entry (sq20, 38.85), unrolled blocks (sq21, 39.16: loads stall
  on lines still filling), array-line prefetch once per 8 (sq22, 38.79; prefetched the radius line,
  not the flag's), the same prefetching the flag line (sq23, 38.45 = sq19, more code). What remains of
  the walk is one body line per node per call: 7000 line touches per tick.
- Memory: 2.6 KB of data (two 320-entry arrays).

Checkpoint after step 1: **G = 38.4 hw ms/tick.** 30 x G alone is 1153 ms per second of game time, so
even with no drawing the square still runs slower than real time; the rendering allowance at 15 or
30 fps is negative. Remaining gap: G must fall another 13.4 ms (to 25, leaving R 16.7 at 15 fps) to
18.4 ms (to 20, leaving R 26.7 at 15 fps or 13.3 at 30 fps), and R from 65 to that allowance.

### Items 2-4 of the revised order (2026-09-24)

- **Ordered active effects: GAME_ESP_OWNER (committed 158b4d6), -0.33 retained.** A live-slot
  bitmap for the pool scans lost (sq25, +0.29: the ~421 live slots carry the cost, and the bit walk
  reloads globals around every call). What won is narrower: live esp slots are counted per owner
  bucket ((owner>>4 ^ owner>>10) & 63, maintained at PullEsp/PushEsp and every info.pEm write, and
  recounted after array alloc/free/push/pop), so EspDelete(c != 0) returns without scanning when the
  owner has no live effects (79% of 14336 calls). Slot order, reuse and RNG are untouched: nothing
  else changes. EspgenDelete (0.13) and EfmDelete (0.27) are the same shape but EfmDelete visits dead
  works by id, which cannot be tracked exactly; left as follow-ups.
- **Actor matrix composition: ACTOR_SKIN_FTRV (committed dd8c4aa), -1.03 drawn.** Render only;
  logic STRICT; 0.0007 px worst over 22.1M on-screen points (numeric check build, not screenshots:
  wall-clock screenshots are not tick-matched and differ by 30-70k px between two control runs).
- **One gameplay matrix chain, first exact attempt: GAME_PWC_FUSE dropped (sq29, +0.54).** Bit-exact
  (1.05M fused parts, 1.8M reused reciprocals) but only ~275 parts per tick take the uniform-scale
  path. The next candidate is an FTRV skeleton chain under the last-bit policy, with the agreed
  numerical checks plus a shadow comparison of hit, grounding and collision decisions.

**Checkpoint (option 3, after collision, effects and actor matrices):** G = **38.09 hw ms/tick**
retained (sq26, reproduced by sq30); drawing every tick W = **101.69** (sq28), so R = W - G = **63.60**.
The 15 fps real-time identity needs 2G + R = W + G <= 66.7: today it is 139.78, a gap of **73.1 ms**;
at 30 fps W <= 33.3 per tick, a gap of **68.4 ms**. The rendering allowance is still negative (30 x G =
1143 ms per second of game time before anything is drawn).

Attribution uses paired arms with one G (review 2026-09-24, re4-research/dca3-sh4zam-20260924/
CHECKPOINT_REVIEW.md; an earlier draft mixed the old G with the new W):

| pair | W | G | R = W - G | W + G |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sq27 before FTRV | 102.72 | 38.09 | 64.63 | 140.81 |
| sq28 after FTRV | 101.69 | 38.09 | 63.60 | 139.78 |

Historical stack comparison (not a paced acceptance run): sq15/sq16 W 104.46, G 39.54, W + G 144.00 ->
139.78 now, **-4.22 ms**. The study items are each worth about a millisecond; none changes the order
of the gap. Allocations (not predictions) that keep both targets visible:

| retained G | R allowance at 15 fps | R allowance at 30 fps |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 20 | 26.67 | 13.33 |
| 25 | 16.67 | 8.33 |

against R = 63.60 today. The next architectural checkpoint must show a costed path for BOTH G and R,
with the unresolved gaps stated; another successful kernel alone does not establish it.

**Scope of the FTRV evidence:** tr12's 0.0007 px is the maximum over accepted synthetic probes (eight
corners 50 units around each bone, both results past the near plane, reference on screen), not over
rendered vertices, and it did not measure clipping agreement. Clipped triangles are rebuilt from
world_of + project, which never read the FTRV matrix, so the matrix reaches the image only through
each vertex's screen x/y, 1/w and outcode byte (cull / copy / clip decisions). The tr13 check build
compares exactly those, for every submitted skinned vertex, before any filtering: each skinned run of
records goes through the same vertex kernel a second time with the scalar-built matrix.

tr13 (ACTOR_SKIN_FTRV=2, r101 square, logic trace STRICT vs tr2 over 3237 ticks):
- Real vertices: 47.9M skinned vertices, run lengths identical, **0 nonfinite** in either path,
  **0 near-plane and 0 far classification differences**. The near plane was exercised: 207,840
  vertices behind it (clipped triangles) and 39,292 within twice the near distance. On-screen max
  difference **0.0017 px** (0 above 0.25 px); max over all vertices in front of the near plane
  (off-screen included) 0.0186 px; max relative 1/w difference 2.3e-6.
- 3 vertices out of 47.9M differ in a screen-edge outcode bit (a vertex within ~0.002 px of an edge).
  Screen bits only cull a whole strip when every corner is past the same edge, so the most such a
  flip can change is whether a strip lying entirely on the edge is dropped: nothing visible (the PVR
  scissors the rest).
- Synthetic probes, now counted before the filter: 18.0M points, 0 near-plane disagreements,
  0 nonfinite, max 0.0007 px.
Clipped geometry itself is identical by construction (world_of + project, which don't read the matrix).

**Bound on the next skeleton experiment:** Concat 1.53 + MultVec 1.04 + Inverse 0.63 = 3.20 hw ms/tick
in sq26, so even a free matrix kernel cannot supply 13-18 ms. The prototype covers one complete
representative actor update (compact hot inputs, parent-ordered batched matrix work, fewer
intermediate stores/reloads, only dependency-proven omissions), timed with input gathering, output
writes, the original fallback and validation separately; then the agreed hit / grounding / collision
decision shadow checks (candidate order and accumulated state included, not only a decision hash).
Report the whole-square change in G and the actor/type coverage before expanding it; one actor's
kernel speedup is not extrapolated.

Cost bound for the Ganado (sq26 per-call costs x call counts; skeleton audit part counts): Ganados
account for 740 of 1390 part-world updates per tick (MotionMove's two passes around IK on all 14,
plus cEm10::move's pass after neck / waist). A part costs ~3.1 us (partsWorldCalc self 2.1 +
Concat / MultVec / TransMatrix share), so **~2.3 ms**; local matrices (partsMatCalc: RotMatrix,
Trans, Scale, Copy) **~1.4**; motion keys (Hermite, MotionMoveCore, Fcc) **~1.2**; IK **~0.3**. A
complete Ganado skeleton update is **~5.2 hw ms/tick**, so even a free one is worth ~5 and a 2x
faster one ~2.6: the prototype cannot close the G gap alone, and the G route has to be assembled
from several items of this size.

Queued exact lead (collision, found while bounding): RotVector (Euler matrix via low_RotMatrix: up
to three SINF/COSF pairs, then MultVec) runs 770 times per tick, 675 of them from cAtariInfo::getPos,
which EmAtCheck repeats for every candidate body on each of its 46.5 calls although a body's offset
and angles rarely change between them. Cost ~1.85 hw ms/tick (getPos 0.28, RotVector 0.09,
low_RotMatrix 0.55, SINF/COSF 0.77, MultVec 0.16). RotVector is a pure function of the offset and
angle bits, so a value-keyed memo is exact. (The skeleton audit's 12% low_RotMatrix repeat rate
was measured per destination matrix, a stack temporary here, so it does not bound this.)

**Result (GAME_ROTVEC_MEMO, 7d0401d, 2026-09-25): -0.54 hw ms/tick on its own rows, exact.** Only
yaw-only angles are memoised (low_RotMatrix treats rot.x and rot.z == 0.0f, either sign, as sin 0 /
cos 1, so the key is src + rot.y); an entry is one aligned 32-byte line, 256 entries (8 KB). tr24:
3.21M calls, 80.5% hits, 0.66% non-yaw calls, 0 mismatches, logic trace STRICT vs tr19 over 4381
frames. RotVector + low_RotMatrix + SINF/COSF 1.62 -> 1.08 (sq35 -> sq39). The first six-word form
(40-byte entries, sq38) saved less on these rows (1.18): both lines of its entry missed ~68% of
lookups (per-PC profile). Whole-square work moved -0.21 (sq39) / -0.39 (sq38), differences between
them spread over unrelated rows: build-layout noise (~+-0.3). The lookup and the src / angle loads
(caller data, missed in the original too) remain; the rest of the 1.85 is getPos and MultVec.

Measurement rule from these arms: exclude the pacing wait rows (re4dc_pace_end,
re4dc_vi_retrace_count) from never-draw totals. They are spin time that follows Flycast timing: ~0.01
in earlier arms, 0.2-0.7 in these. Work G = total - those rows.

### Skeleton prototype: GAME_SKEL_FTRV on the Ganado part-world pass (2026-09-24)

Scope: every partsWorldCalc run inside cEm10::move (an `extern "C"` scope counter set by a guard at
its top), i.e. the Ganado's whole update: MotionMove's two passes around IK and the pass after neck /
waist. Observed coverage (tr14/tr15 counters): 3.03M of 5.68M part updates (53%), 99.99% id 0x15
(the square's Ganados), 28 parts id 0x12. Last-bit FP policy, not exact.

- **v1, column form (sq31, dropped, +0.69):** each part's concat as four FTRVs over l_mat's
  columns with the parent's matrix loaded from a 64-entry column-major table of this call's
  results. Instructions -146k per tick, but the 5.6 KB table evicted part data from the SH-4's
  16 KB direct-mapped operand cache: partsWorldCalc dmiss 0.32 -> 0.55 and unrelated readers of the
  same parts slower (PSMTXCopy +0.19, RotMatrix +0.15).
- **v2, row form (sq33, 37.38 vs control sq32 38.10: -0.72 hw ms/tick):** row i of P L is l_mat^T
  applied to row i of P, so the part's own l_mat rows are loaded into XMTRX (12 loads in the back
  bank, constant row 0 0 0 1) and the parent's three rows, read in place, come out through three
  FTRVs as mat's rows, with world as their fourth element. No table, no transposes, no temporaries;
  a non-uniform parent scale folds in as P's rows times S^-1 and l_mat's columns times S (translation
  column row-scaled so world stays P l_t); a parent scale component of 0 takes the original
  arithmetic, addRot parts finish on the original code. Function rows: partsWorldCalc 2.92 -> 2.54,
  Concat -0.37, TransMatrix -0.12, MultVec -0.05; instructions -241k per tick (-4.6%).
- Numerical check (tr15, =2: FTRV pass in shadow, original live, chained through shadow parents):
  3.03M parts, max world difference 0.0039 units (2-4 ulp at |x| ~ 8130), max rotation element
  4.8e-7, 0 nonfinite; logic trace STRICT over 3277 ticks.
- Timing split: input gathering (12 l_mat + 12 parent loads) and output writes (12 mat + 3 world +
  3 r_scale stores) are inline with the three FTRVs, so the hardware model attributes them to
  partsWorldCalc's row as a whole (2.54 ms for all models, of which Ganado parts now take the FTRV
  path); the fallback (zero scale, addRot) and the =2 validation do not run in the cost arm.
- Against the bound: -0.72 of the ~2.3 ms Ganado part-world cost. The local-matrix stage (~1.4),
  motion keys (~1.2) and IK (~0.3) are untouched.
- Gameplay check (GAME_DECISION_TRACE=1, LOGIC_TRACE arms tr18 control / tr19 FTRV live, 4339
  frames; tr16 / tr17 before the line-query hash was added gave the same picture): identical every
  frame: RNG, System / Stop / Status / Room / Scenario flags, room, player / enemy / object discrete
  state (be_flag, routine numbers, id / type, HP, motion state), alive counts, 2.6M em-em collision
  results in call order, 62k area checks, 179k damage hit tests; **0 drift** in the player and in
  every enemy position (43.6k samples). The part matrices and object coordinates differ (the last-bit
  change itself). Of 328k scenery line queries, 8 frames (one every 400-700) differ: in each the FTRV
  run makes **one extra line query** (+20..36 candidate polygon tests) and nothing downstream changes.
  The instrumentation itself is read-only (tr18 STRICT vs tr2).
- Those extra queries are run-to-run noise of the sound system, not the FTRV change: two runs of the
  same code differ the same way (controls tr16 / tr18: 5 frames, tr18 / tr20: 2; FTRV tr19 / tr21: 4).
  A per-query log around the frames (private GAME_DECISION_TRACE=2 arms tr20 / tr21, caller names from
  each build's symbols) shows the extra query is **sndWallCheck**, the sound situation's occlusion line
  from a sound source to the listener, answering "no wall"; it follows audio timing, not logic ticks,
  and the logic trace stays STRICT across all control runs. **Result: no hit, grounding, collision,
  area or damage decision attributable to GAME_SKEL_FTRV, and no position drift.**
- Accepted under the agreed last-bit rules (numerical check tr15 + decision comparison tr18 / tr19);
  GAME_SKEL_FTRV=1 joins LH. Not extrapolated: coverage is the Ganados' part-world pass (53% of part
  updates); the other models, the local-matrix stage and the motion keys are separate items.

| UI images | ~1.5 | resolve 0.70 (264), load 0.56 (41.6 x 13 us), image_key 0.15, decode/word copies |
| Copies | 3.4 | memset / memcpy loops (MakeWeightPalette clears, pass_lights and draw_model_part copies, texture words) |
| KOS / TA | 1.4 | mutexes, sq_lock |

(Classes overlap slightly with the area table: the hardware model files the packet plumbing under
"ui".) Candidates that look avoidable without a renderer rewrite, none measured yet:
- the actor path's duplicate reservation (re4dc_actor_submit reserves, then direct_begin ->
  packet_begin reserves again): ~12.6 us of plumbing per direct part x 164 parts, ~2.1 ms, of which
  one reservation and a lean begin could save perhaps ~1;
- UI images resolved / loaded each frame (41.6 loads per tick): ~1-1.5 if they are cacheable;
- GXGetProjectionv + a copy per part draw, software ctz in finish_source_draws, MakeWeightPalette's
  clears: ~0.5 together.
**About 3-4 ms of R is plumbing that looks avoidable; ~38 ms scales with what is drawn (vertices,
meshlets, lights) and ~10 is the game's own draw preparation.** R <= 26.7 (G = 20) or 16.7 (G = 25)
therefore needs far less drawn per view (the Low-mode per-view asset budget: ~15-20k scenery
triangles, <= 3 full Ganados, Ganado L1/L2 meshes), not preparation tuning; packet and matrix
savings are not to be counted twice against the actor path.

### Reassessment after the skeleton prototype and the census (2026-09-24)

Measured: G 39.54 (sq16) -> 37.38 (sq33, paired control sq32 38.10); R 64.63 -> 63.60 (sq27/sq28 pair,
before GAME_SKEL_FTRV). W + G with the skeleton change is not yet measured as one arm (estimate
~138: the retained saving also lands in W). Costed path, estimates until measured, not counted twice:

| work | today | identified next items (estimates) | after them | needed (15 fps / 30 fps) |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| G, retained | 37.4 (36.8-37.2 after GAME_ROTVEC_MEMO, measured) | RotVector memo (done: -0.54 on its rows, not ~1.5); Ganado local matrices <= 1.4; motion keys <= 1.2; FSCA trig 1.5-2.0 (last-bit); scenery collision rejection 0.8-1.5 (exact); remaining part-world passes (Leon, objects) ~0.5 | ~30-32 | 20-25 |
| R, per image | 63.6 | packet plumbing ~1, UI image caching ~1-1.5, small copies / GX calls ~0.5 | ~60-61 | 16.7-26.7 / 8.3-13.3 |

**Unresolved gaps: G ~5-12 ms, R ~33-44 ms at 15 fps (more at 30).** Neither closes by tuning the
current per-tick and per-image work. R has to come from drawing less per view (the Low-mode per-view
budget and Ganado meshes, a measured scenery triangle budget); G's remaining gap needs structural
reductions in how much simulation runs per tick (e.g. unseen parked Ganados computing only the part
chains gameplay reads, already listed in the skeleton audit, ~1.6-2.4) on top of the items above.

## 30 fps proposal adopted into this plan (2026-09-24, C:\Game Dev\Emulators\RE4_30FPS_PLAN_2026-09-24.md)

(Superseded in part by the revised approach above: the 14 ms allocation is retired.)

Engineering budgets (targets, not forecasts) for one tick: required simulation + shared model work
14, actor presentation 8, scenery 5, packets/copies/submission/HUD/system 3, margin 3.3. Order:
1. Explain the 39.5 retained ms by function and consumer (collision, attachments, hit volumes, events,
   AI, RNG, thermal scope, shadows); bypass only proven presentation-only work, STRICT.
2. Skeleton maths (FTRV/FIPR kernels, batching, reuse of unchanged outputs) under the last-bit FP
   policy with a shadow comparison of hit/grounding/collision decisions; compact collision candidate
   data with conservative rejection before the exact tests (order and ties preserved); effect
   bookkeeping without changing RNG, order or rate.
3. An integrated 8 ms actor path for Leon + the six active Ganados (submission, preparation, packets).
4. r101 scenery to a measured 5 ms (asset pipeline: compact groups, baked light, hidden-surface removal).
5. Serial integration; 15 fps at full speed as the intermediate gate, then 30 fps with no routine skips.
Knob sweeps (fog, prefetch, crowd tiers) no longer take the main effort.

Square census (ACT_CAP_LOG): 14 live Ganados, 6 active (all six must stay active: in view, in range,
engaged), 8 parked. Tighter caps gain nothing; the remaining logic is Leon, collision, effects and the six.

Top functions (sq0): re4dc_actor_submit 16.9, MeshDraw::draw 8.8, pass_lights 5.1, cModel::partsWorldCalc
4.2, PSMTXConcat 3.9, mesh_submit 3.4, vp::transform 3.1, atchkCollect 2.2, PSMTXMultVec 1.9.
Logic split: animation/skeleton ~10-11, vector helpers ~4.1, collision ~5.7, effects/cloth/AI ~6.

## Plan (in order; each item measured in the square before it goes on a user disc)

1. **Logic speed-ups, logic STRICT unless noted.**
   - a. GAME_VEC_INLINE: small PSVEC* routines inline (the SDK C bodies, same op order). Est. -1.5..-2/tick.
   - b. Collision fast paths with exact answers (At_poly_line_ck, blkPolyLineCk, cSatBlock::lineOverlap,
     hitCheckSphere): cheaper rejection before the exact test. Est. -1.5..-2/tick.
   - c. Bone matrices on FTRV (partsWorldCalc, PSMTXConcat/MultVec in logic): last-bit FP policy, measured,
     collision checked separately. Est. -4..-5/tick.
2. **Offline-converted enemies (DCA3 lesson: convert everything offline).** Ganado v4 blobs from
   design-ganado (prebuilt L0/L2/L2 Standard, L1/L2/L2 Low), no runtime conversion or LOD-build workspace;
   flat Ganado lighting. The same for em21/em23/em2a. Est. -6..-12 in fights, plus heap.
3. **Converted Standard room archive with per-part residency (DCA3 CdStreamDC model).** Drop the GameCube
   display lists and texture payloads that the native packages already replace; keep collision, map-object
   records, events, lights. First count every remaining walker of the GX geometry (thermal scope, shadows).
   Frees heap 4 (the r100 ambush is ~400 KB short) and load time.
4. **Single-version scenery (PS2 approach) with better textures.** One cheap mesh per tree/house instead of
   runtime distance levels (user: "we spend more time translating it at different viewing distances");
   512 VQ house shells with baked lighting; Standard fog 15-18 m with a painted backdrop. PS2 r100 scenery is
   77k tris vs GC 337k, one version per object (ps2-blender/ps2/ps2-summary.json). Review disc first.
5. **Visibility table (PVS) for the square.** It is walled in by houses; skip scenery and actor draws that
   cannot be seen from the player's zone. Measure the hidden share first.
6. **Queued disc reads** (64 KiB chunks, audio-aware): unavoidable in-play reads stop stalling frames.
7. **Selective -O3 / LTO build experiment** (DCA3 build policy): hot kernels -O3, cold code -Os.
8. **Pacing:** Fast is the default (user preference), PACE_CAP=2 so pictures may drop to 10 fps before the
   game ever runs slower than real time while the items above land.
9. **Knob sweeps first (free):** CROWD_NEAR/CROWD_NEAR_M/CROWD_MID_M/CROWD_MID_PX, MESH_LOD_PX,
   NATIVE_ACTOR_LOD_PX, FOG_FAR (Standard), measured in the square.

PS2 comparison (2026-09-24, emleon00.esl from BIO4DAT.AFS vs the GC list; probe enemy-census/ps2/):
the PS2 r101 roster is the GC roster (43 em15, 1 em26, 2 em28, same waves and positions). Differences:
entries 26 and 27 (two Ganados at x ~38.8 m by the far house) and em28 entry 78 start inactive (be 0) on
PS2, and entries 34-36 carry flag bit 0x80 with ch 0. So the PS2 did not thin the square's crowd; its
outdoor savings were draw distance, single-version scenery and effects (see memory notes).

Checked and dropped (2026-09-24):
- r101 draw-plan cache: 0 misses in the harness square. The play session's rejects built up over longer
  play; revisit only with a play log, since KOS has ~3 KB free there.
- Block model pool: it creates map objects (SMD, cObj id 2). Not droppable.
- "native parts run": the game's own cParts/cModelInfo/cEm/cObj work. Real state.

## Memory track (r100 post-house ambush, heap 4)

Census at the failure: heap 4 8,967,552 B, 3,968 B free. r100.dar 2.62 MB, enemy archives 1.62 MB, block
pool 1.13 MB, em12 hot motion 1.00 MB, parts work 0.92 MB, Standard scenery packages 0.77 MB, esp pool
0.34 MB (peak 538 of 1024 slots), prim buffer 0.32 MB (peak 223 KB). A loaded save reached r101
(minimum 389 KB free; one 530 KB event-data load failed without a crash). Target: half the GameCube's
headroom at the same point (Dolphin reference with the GC debug disc: `C:\Game Dev\Emulators\Dolphin`).
Fixes come from items 3 and 4 plus an esp pool cap.
