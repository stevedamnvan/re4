# KOS mounts /cd by reading the *low density* table of contents
# (fs_iso9660.c calls cdrom_read_toc(&toc, false)) and taking the last data
# track it finds there. In a GDI the payload track lives in the high density
# area, so KOS never sees it and every fs_open("/cd/...") returns -1 even
# though the same image boots: the bootstrap reads the high density track
# directly. A CD-R image keeps the one data track where KOS looks for it.
